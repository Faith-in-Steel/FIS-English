Its ability to protect convoys, actively hunt submarines and support amphibious operations through the aircraft it carries made it very useful and cost effective, freeing up the more expensive fleet carriers for other tasks. The ships themselves, however, are only lightly armed, lightly armored, and of far smaller displacement than fleet carriers."

 POR_SS_equipment_1912: "Foca Class"
 POR_SS_equipment_1912_desc: "The Portuguese Foca-class represented three small submarines built in Italy for the Portuguese Navy shortly after the Great War. They were enlarged versions of the Italian Espadarte-class and the sister ships of the Spanish A-class. They displaced only 260 tons and were armed with two 450mm torpedo tubes. All three ships were decommissioned by the mid-1930s."
 POR_SS_equipment_1916: "Delfim Class"
 POR_SS_equipment_1916_desc: "The Delfim-class consisted of a pair of submarines originally ordered and laid down in Italy for the Portuguese Navy in the early 1930s. The order was cancelled and they ships were instead completed for the Italian Navy. They were based on the large, Italian Squalo-class, displacing 980 tons and armed with eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 POR_SS_equipment_1933: "Narval Class"
 POR_SS_equipment_1933_desc: "The Narval-class consisted of three British Subtle-class submarines that were commissioned in 1945 and sold to Portugal after World War II. They displaced 840 tons and were armed with seven 533mm torpedo tubes."
 POR_DD_equipment_1900: "Douro Class"
 POR_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "The Douro-class was a-class of seven destroyers launched in the early 1930s. They were built in both Portugal and the U.K. Two of the ships were sold to Colombia in 1934. The ships displaced over 1,200 tons and were armed with four BL 4.7 in. guns and eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ### PRU - PERU ###
 PRU_SS_equipment_1912: "R Class"
 PRU_SS_equipment_1912_desc: "The Peruvian R-class submarines consisted of four subs ordered from and built by the U.S. in the mid-1920s. They were essentially identical to the U.S. R-class submarines, displacing over 570 tons and armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes."
 PRU_DD_equipment_1900: "Almirante Villar Class"
 PRU_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "The Almirante Villar and Amirante Guise were two former Russian Novik-class destroyers. They had a roundabout path to the Peruvian Navy, sailing under the flags of both the U.K. and Estonia before finally being delivered to Peru in 1934. They were armed with four 102mm/60 caliber guns and nine 533mm torpedo tubes. They displaced over 1,200 tons and had decent speed for their size and vintage."
 PRU_CL_equipment_1900: "Almirante Grau Class"
 PRU_CL_equipment_1900_desc: "The Almirante Grau-class consisted of two pre-WWI light cruisers built in Britain for the Peruvian Navy and commissioned in 1907. Even for a light cruiser, the ships were fairly small, displacing only 3,100 tons, and had below-average speed as well. They were lightly armored and had twin 152mm/50 caliber Vickers guns as their main armament."
 ### RAJ - BRITISH RAJ ###
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1912: "L Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1912_desc: "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine-classes. They were built in the late stages of the Great War and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1916: "T Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1916_desc: "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R-class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1922: "U Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1922_desc: "The U-class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the-class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1933: "V Class"
 RAJ_SS_equipment_1933_desc: "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1900: "V/W Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W-classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the Great War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of the Great War and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1912: "G/H/I Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1912_desc: "The G, H, and I-class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F-class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H-classes were the same as in the F-class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1916: "J/K/N Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1916_desc: "The J, K, and N-classes were similar to the earlier Tribal-class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1922: "Battle Class"
 RAJ_DD_equipment_1922_desc: "The Battle-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1900: "C Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1900_desc: "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the Great War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during the Great War and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 RAJ_basic_light_cruiser: "Southampton Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1912: "Southampton Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1912_desc: "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1922: "Crown Colony Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1922_desc: "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town-class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1933: "Minotaur Class"
 RAJ_CL_equipment_1933_desc: "Also known as the Swiftsure-class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony-class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony-class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1895: "Hawkins Class"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1895_desc: "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1906: "Surrey Class"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1906_desc: "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1922: "Admiral Class"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1922_desc: "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1933: "Churchill Design"
 RAJ_CA_equipment_1933_desc: "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland-class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1912: "Renown Class"
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1912_desc: "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of the Great War. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1916: "Princess Royal Class"
 RAJ_BC_equipment_1916_desc: "The Princess Royal was a-class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1895: "Revenge Class"
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1895_desc: "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the-class, only 5 were finished."
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1900: "King George V Class"
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1900_desc: "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1906: "Lion Class"
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1906_desc: "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up-class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1912: "Vanguard Class"
 RAJ_BB_equipment_1912_desc: "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The-class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge-class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 RAJ_SHBB_equipment_1936: "Centurion Class"
 RAJ_SHBB_equipment_1936_desc: "The Centurion was a-class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 RAJ_SHBB_equipment_1945: "Lion II Class"
 RAJ_SHBB_equipment_1945_desc: "The Lion II-class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1930: "Courageous Class"
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1930_desc: "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1933: "Ark Royal Class"
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1933_desc: "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1936: "Illustrious Class"
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1936_desc: "The Illustrious-class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1940: "Implacable Class"
 RAJ_CV_equipment_1940_desc: "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious-class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious-class."
 ### ROM - ROMANIA ###
 ROM_SS_equipment_1912: "Delfinul Class"

 ROM_SS_equipment_1922: "Requinul Class"
 ROM_SS_equipment_1922_desc: "The Requinul and Marsuinul submarines were built by the Germans for their Romanian allies. They were commissioned in 1943. The ships were based on the German Type VII submarines. The ships were medium-sized submarines, displacing 600 tons, and were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ROM_DD_equipment_1900: "Marasti Class"
 ROM_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "The Marasti-class was a-class of destroyers built for Romania during the Great War. The four ships of the-class were requisitioned by the Italian Navy during the war, and two were eventually sold to Romania in the early 1920s. They were larger destroyers, displacing over 1,400 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 Schneider-Canet-Armstrong guns and four 450mm torpedo tubes. They had average speed and reliability for their vintage."

 ### SAF - SOUTH AFRICA ###
 SAF_SS_equipment_1912: "L Class"
 SAF_SS_equipment_1912_desc: "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine-classes. They were built in the late stages of the Great War and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SAF_SS_equipment_1916: "T Class"
 SAF_SS_equipment_1916_desc: "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R-class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 SAF_SS_equipment_1922: "U Class"
 SAF_SS_equipment_1922_desc: "The U-class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the-class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 SAF_SS_equipment_1933: "V Class"
 SAF_SS_equipment_1933_desc: "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 SAF_DD_equipment_1900: "V/W Class"
 SAF_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W-classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the Great War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of the Great War and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SAF_DD_equipment_1912: "G/H/I Class"
 SAF_DD_equipment_1912_desc: "The G, H, and I-class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F-class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H-classes was the same as in the F-class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SAF_DD_equipment_1916: "J/K/N Class"
 SAF_DD_equipment_1916_desc: "The J, K, and N-classes were similar to the earlier Tribal-class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SAF_DD_equipment_1922: "Battle Class"
 SAF_DD_equipment_1922_desc: "The Battle-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SAF_CL_equipment_1900: "C Class"
 SAF_CL_equipment_1900_desc: "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the Great War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during the Great War and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 SAF_CL_equipment_1912: "Southampton Class"
 SAF_CL_equipment_1912_desc: "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 SAF_CL_equipment_1922: "Crown Colony Class"
 SAF_CL_equipment_1922_desc: "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town-class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 SAF_CL_equipment_1933: "Minotaur Class"
 SAF_CL_equipment_1933_desc: "Also known as the Swiftsure-class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony-class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony-class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 SAF_CA_equipment_1895: "Hawkins Class"
 SAF_CA_equipment_1895_desc: "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 SAF_CA_equipment_1906: "Surrey Class"
 SAF_CA_equipment_1906_desc: "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 SAF_CA_equipment_1922: "Admiral Class"
 SAF_CA_equipment_1922_desc: "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 SAF_CA_equipment_1933: "Churchill Design"
 SAF_CA_equipment_1933_desc: "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland-class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 SAF_BC_equipment_1912: "Renown Class"
 SAF_BC_equipment_1912_desc: "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of the Great War. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 SAF_BC_equipment_1916: "Princess Royal Class"
 SAF_BC_equipment_1916_desc: "The Princess Royal was a-class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SAF_BB_equipment_1895: "Revenge Class"
 SAF_BB_equipment_1895_desc: "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the-class, only 5 were finished."
 SAF_BB_equipment_1900: "King George V Class"
 SAF_BB_equipment_1900_desc: "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 SAF_BB_equipment_1906: "Lion Class"
 SAF_BB_equipment_1906_desc: "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up-class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 SAF_BB_equipment_1912: "Vanguard Class"
 SAF_BB_equipment_1912_desc: "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and it was finished after the war. The-class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge-class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 SAF_SHBB_equipment_1936: "Centurion Class"
 SAF_SHBB_equipment_1936_desc: "The Centurion was a-class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 SAF_SHBB_equipment_1945: "Lion II Class"
 SAF_SHBB_equipment_1945_desc: "The Lion II-class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 SAF_CV_equipment_1930: "Courageous Class"
 SAF_CV_equipment_1930_desc: "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."

 SIA_DD_equipment_1900: "Phra Ruang Class"
 SIA_DD_equipment_1900_desc: "The Phra Ruang was a former British R-class destroyer that was sold to The Royal Thai Navy in 1920. The ship displaced just over 1,000 tons and was armed with three 120mm/45 QF Mk IV guns and four 533mm torpedo tubes. They had good speed, range, and reliability for their vintage."
 SIA_CL_equipment_1922: "Taskin Class"
 SIA_CL_equipment_1922_desc: "The Taskin-class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
 SIA_CA_equipment_1895: "Sri Ayuthia Class"
 SIA_CA_equipment_1895_desc: "The Sri Ayuthia-class coastal defense ships were perhaps the last ships of this type built in the world, with both ships of the-class built in Japan and commissioned for the Royal Thai Navy in 1938. The design was comparable to a small cruiser (or large destroyer) in size, to a battleship in speed, and to a heavy cruiser in armament. Its main guns were four 203mm/53 3-Shiki cannon. They were lightly armored compared to contemporary heavy cruisers."

 VIC_DD_equipment_1916: "L'Intrépide Class"
 VIC_DD_equipment_1916_desc: "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers were a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi-class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, with an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons and larger engines."
 VIC_DD_equipment_1922: "Hoche Class"
 VIC_DD_equipment_1922_desc: "The Hoche and Bayard-classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both-classes were based on the Mogador-class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines.

 VIC_CL_equipment_1912: "La Galissonnière Class"
 VIC_CL_equipment_1912_desc: "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin-class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 VIC_CL_equipment_1922: "De Grasse Class"
 VIC_CL_equipment_1922_desc: "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament, as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 VIC_CL_equipment_1933: "Colbert Class"
 VIC_CL_equipment_1933_desc: "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse was that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 VIC_CA_equipment_1895: "Suffren Class"
 VIC_CA_equipment_1895_desc: "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne-class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both-classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy: very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 VIC_CA_equipment_1906: "Algérie Class"
 VIC_CA_equipment_1906_desc: "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous-classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara-class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection was considerably increased. Its AA armament was adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement was over 10,000 tons."
 VIC_CA_equipment_1922: "Saint Louis Class"
 VIC_CA_equipment_1922_desc: "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie-class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu-class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie-class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 VIC_CA_equipment_1933: "Forbin Class"
 VIC_CA_equipment_1933_desc: "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis-class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis-class as well as British Crown Colony-class."
 VIC_BC_equipment_1912: "Durand-Viel Design"
 VIC_BC_equipment_1912_desc: "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to the Great War. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon-classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before the Great War broke out."
 VIC_BC_equipment_1916: "Dunkerque Class"
 VIC_BC_equipment_1916_desc: "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 VIC_BB_equipment_1895: "Courbet Class"
 VIC_BB_equipment_1895_desc: "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the Great War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during the Great War, but were active during WWII. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante-class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WWII were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 #VIC_BB_equipment_1895b: "Bretagne Class" 
 VIC_BB_equipment_1900: "Richelieu Class"
 VIC_BB_equipment_1900_desc: "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 VIC_BB_equipment_1906: "Gascogne Class"
 VIC_BB_equipment_1906_desc: "The Gascogne-class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu-class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 VIC_BB_equipment_1912: "Alsace Class"
 VIC_BB_equipment_1912_desc: "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu-class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improved upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 VIC_SHBB_equipment_1936: "Charlemagne Class"
 VIC_SHBB_equipment_1936_desc: "The Charlemagne-class of super battleships was a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They featured a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrowed elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson-classes."
 VIC_SHBB_equipment_1945: "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 VIC_SHBB_equipment_1945_desc: "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne-classes. Its heavy armament was distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provided the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1930: "Béarn Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1930_desc: "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1933: "Joffre Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1933_desc: "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1936: "Jean Bart Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1936_desc: "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu-class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 VIC_CV_equipment_1940: "Clemenceau Class"
 VIC_CV_equipment_1940_desc: "The Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre-class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau-class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
