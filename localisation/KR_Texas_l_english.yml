###Events###

Texas.0.t:0 "Electors Defy Majority"
Texas.0.d:0 "News out of Texas today has caused outrage among its populace. Specifically, the news that the state’s appointed electors had defied the will of the people and cast their votes for John Nance Garner instead of Huey Long, who had won the state’s popular vote. While they are technically within their rights to go against the will of the populace, many have attempted to sue them, and the case looks like it is going to the Supreme Court. "
Texas.0.b:0 "The case is taken to the Supreme Court!"
Texas.0.a:0 "The Electors Back Down!"

Texas.1.t:0 "The Supreme Court's Decision"
Texas.1.d:0 "The Case of Citizens vs. the State of Texas has now gained nationwide coverage, as almost everyone weighs in on this failure of the democratic system. Anger in Texas is brewing over this, despite the fact that the Electors really do not have any mandate to go along with the Popular Vote. At the end, the verdict is: "
Texas.1.b:0 "They have no obligation"
Texas.1.a:0 "The Electors must vote in accordance to the popular vote!"

Texas.2.t:0 "Violence in Texas"
Texas.2.d:0 "The outcome of the Supreme Court case has angered almost everyone in Texas, a state that voted overwhelmingly for Huey Long. Many AFP chapters in Texas have denounced the descicion, and many Democrats such as Martin Dies Jr. have switched lines and joined the AFP. As riots spiralled out of control, Minutemen and SPA-aligned militias clashed in the street, and the National Guard refused to take any action. "
Texas.2.a:0 "Terrible!"

Texas.3.t:0 "Bleeding Texas"
Texas.3.d:0 "After weeks of sporadic violence in Texas, a new term has been keyed. “Bleeding Texas” is what it’s called, and what it is the vast amount of bloodshed that has taken hold in the state. The Police have been powerless to stop them, as even they have joined in the rioting, and the Texas National Guard; split on party lines has refused to take any action to calm the situation. "
Texas.3.a:0 "Damn..."

Texas.4.t:0 "Dealing with Texas"
Texas.4.d:0 "The situation in Texas has gained national attention, as bystanders and Politicians alike call for action from the state and federal governments. President Huey Long has been reluctant to act so far, but now seems like a good time to act. Of course, he could just let the situation sort itself out. "
Texas.4.a:0 "Declare Martial Law!"
Texas.4.b:0 "This is too much work, let them sort it out"
Texas.4.c:0 "Work with the AFP"

Texas.5.t:0 "The Oil fields Burn!"
Texas.5.d:0 "Horror in the Texan oil Industry, as the operators of the Oil Wells woke up to their rigs being burned. This has crippled the oil industry in Texas, but has left oil wells operated by Texaco completely unharmed"
Texas.5.a:0 "Clearly an act of corporate sabotage"

Texas.6.t:0 "Peace in Texas- for now"
Texas.6.d:0 "Forces and Texas have stopped fighting, Martial Law has brought violence to a close, and now the People of Texas enjoy some peace"
Texas.6a:0 "Finally"

Texas.7.t:0 "James Allred is considering resigning"
Texas.7.d:0 "Faced with a crisis on his hands, Texas Governor James V. Allred has considered fleeing the sinking ship that is the Texan Government. Numerous assassination attempts have also made him fear for his life in recent weeks, and the deadlocked Texan Senate has made it impossible to govern solidly. Of course, if he can guide Texas through this crisis he could score major political points. "
Texas.7.a:0 "Allred stays."
Texas.7.b:0 "Allred Resigns."

Texas.8.t:0 "Support for Texan Independence Grows"
Texas.8.d:0 "The Federal Government has refused to act, the State of Texas is in chaos because of their incompetence. Huey Long has refused to aid the state, or help bring it out of this crisis, and now many in the state are turning against not just Long, but the Federal Government entirely. In fact, many now flirt with the idea of Secession, and reclaiming Texan independence. "
Texas.8.a:0 "Worrying"

Texas.9.t:0 "Huey Long sits on Texas' Throne"
Texas.9.d:0 "Once Allred resigned a snap election was held, and the result of that election was the America First Party winning handily. Both the Senate and the Governor’s office is secure for the AFP, and now the AFP can focus on fixing the crisis that plagues Texas alone. "
Texas.9.a:0 "Another Ally of New Orleans"

Texas.10.t:0 "Horrific Acts of Violence across Texas"
Texas.10.d:0 "With the local police powerless to enforce Laws in Texas, many criminals normally kept at bay have come out in full force. And not just standard robbers and drunks, killers who have been locked away for years, only to be freed after various Prison Riots. Now these sick individuals strike again, killing at their hearts content without anyone to stop them or enforce the law of the land. "
Texas.10.a:0 "My God!"

Texas.11.t:0 "Looting Spree"
Texas.11.d:0 "As the Texan Government falls apart, so does Texan society. One sign of this is mass sprees of riots and looting, which have taken the state by storm after the collapse of social order. These riots often escalate quickly, as the police are powerless to stop them. As well, in major cities such as Dallas, Austin and Huston looting is commonplace, where every shop is robbed of everything that isn’t nailed down. "
Texas.11.a:0 "Another Symptom of a larger problem"

Texas.13.t:0 "Texas Plunged into Anarchy"
Texas.13.d:0 "The decision made by the supreme court has angered many Texans, who have taken to the streets in protest. Violence, Looting, and Chaos has erupted across the state" 
Texas.13.a:0 "Everything is falling apart"

Texas.12.t:0 "Riots in Texas"
Texas.12.d:0 "The massive upheaval in the face of the Supreme Court's decision, and the failure of law enforcement to contain the problem has plunged Texas into Anarchy. Law enforcement has no effective control of the state, and the streets are under Mob Rule. Regular protests can turn violent at the flick of a wrist, and often many are left dead after alterations with armed opponents. "
Texas.12.a:0 "What did you expect?"

TXS.0.t:0 "An Illegal Referendum in Texas"
TXS.0.d:0 "As the Texan Independence movement has gained more popular support, and as the Nation has fallen into chaos. James Allred has been influenced into the Independence Camp and has held a vote to leave the Union. Allred has founded a new Political Party in Texas, the Independence Party, a Party that will advocate for the best interests of Texas... This vote overwhelmingly passed, and Texas is on the path to leave the Union."
TXS.0.a:0 "These Results are Illegal and Unverified!"
TXS.0.b:0 "We are in no position to stop them!"

TXS.1.t:0 "Texas Leaves!"
TXS.1.d:0 "The Government has failed, Texas has fallen into chaos and the people are fed up with the Federal Government. James Allred has listened to the people's cries and issued a formal Declaration of Secession!"
TXS.1a:0 "The Lone Star Rises! (Play as Texas)"
TXS.1b:0 "Traitors!"

TXS.2.t:0 "Invading Texas?"
TXS.2.d:0 "The Decision of Texas to go it alone was not a shock to Huey Long, the state was violently resisting his rule ever since he was elected President. However, even if Texas hated his guts, it was still too valuable to let go of. The state has massive wealth, oil reserves and industrial centers, and Long would be a fool to let them go. As well, the new fledgling state is in little position to resist him. "
TXS.2.a:0 "Invade Texas now!"
TXS.2.b:0 "Do Nothing"
TXS.2.c:0 "Offer Texas a Deal..."

TXS.3.t:0 "A Deal with Long?"
TXS.3.d:0 "James Allred, the now president of the Second Republic of Texas has just received a telegram from the American Union State’s Capitol of New Orleans. This telegram did not contain a declaration of war like he expected, but rather a proposal. Huey Long had offered the Texan Government a deal, if they side with Long and allow the Texas Branch of the AFP to come to power in Texas, Long would guarantee the state a high level of autonomy within the AUS government, and complete self-governance during the war. "
TXS.3.a:0 "Tell Long where to shove it"
TXS.3.b:0 "We accept!"

TXS.4.t:0 "Texas Accepts"
TXS.4.d:0 "President Huey Long has received an official response from Texan President James Allred. In his telegram he stated that he accepted the deal, and his state was ready to fight for the legitimate American Government. Upon his acceptance, Martin Dies Jr. was sworn in as Texan President and Minuteman units crossed in to the state to defend against the Western Command Center. "
TXS.4.a:0 "We Fight side by Side!"

TXS.5.t:0 "Invading Texas"
TXS.5.d:0 "The state of Texas clearly has a death wish, yet we are not ones to complain when there is an opportunity to strike. Omar Bradley, the commander of the Western American Forces has issued an order to invade the state immediately, hopefully grabbing up an amount of land before Unionist forces could take over. Indeed, now that they are caught up in a war, this is the perfect time to strike and take Texas’ vast riches for ourselves. "
TXS.5a:0 "Time to end this!"

TXS.6.t:0 "Help Texas?"
TXS.6.d:0 "President Haywood has seen the situation in Texas and has seen not a state desperately resisting the forces of traitors (despite them being traitors themselves), but rather an opportunity. It is clear that they can not hope to last out in their current situation, but if we were to reach out to them then perhaps, they could continue to resist the forces of capitalist tyranny. Of course, this would all come at a price. "
TXS.6.a:0 "Let's pile on Texas!"
TXS.6.b:0 "Let's give them a hand"

TXS.7.t:0 "The C.S.A offers us help"
TXS.7.d:0 "A rather unexpected telegram has come to President James Allred, a telegram for the leader of the Socialist Combined Syndicates of America. They see our struggle and are willing to support us if we are willing to install a Syndicalist government. Of course, this would not be a popular move, but in desperate times we may have to take any help we will get. "
TXS.7.a:0 "We would rather die with dignity"
TXS.7.b:0 "We'll take any help we can get"

TXS.8.t:0 "Texas Accepts"
TXS.8.d:0 "Texas has taken our help, they have accepted the help we have offered. Tough negotiations lead to the creation of a Governor of Texas, Head of State with little power. The real power is still with the President"
TXS.8.a:0 "We have a new ally!"

TXS.9.t:0 "Officer Defections"
TXS.9.d:0 "It appears as the loyalty of some of our officers lies not with the Federal Government, but with their home state of Texas. Many notable officers have defected, including General Truscott and Admiral Nimitz, luckily Texan-Born Dwight Eisenhower was smart enough to stick with the Legitimate Government. "
TXS.9.a:0 "Traitors, all of them!"

TXS.10.t:0 "Defections"
TXS.10.d:0 "Several military officials have signed resignations. High and Low-Ranking officials have decided to stay with their native Texas instead of our forces"
TXS.10.a:0 "This doesn't help"

TXS.11.t:0 "Taking Pecos"
TXS.11.d:0 "There is an opportunity to expand our land that just opened. Texas has failed to secure the region of Trans-Pecos, containing the city of El Paso. We have the opportunity to incorporate this region into our nation, should we?"
TXS.11.a:0 "We don't want to get involved"
TXS.11.b:0 "Occupy Trans-Pecos!"

TXS.12.t:0 "An agreement with Texas"
TXS.12.d:0 "Texas has sent us an offer of peace, offering compensation for the return of Trans-Pecos. We can pull our troops out and avoid a war. Should we accept Texas' offer?"
TXS.12.a:0 "We accept the deal, but drop the matter of Trans Pecos"
TXS.12.b:0 "We accept the deal"

TXS.13.t:0 "The deal changed"
TXS.13.d:0 "Mexico has informed us that they accept the deal, but they will not return Trans-Pecos"
TXS.13.a:0 "This means war!"
TXS.13.b:0 "We accept the altered deal"

TXS.14.t:0 "Election of [GetYear]"
TXS.14.desc:0 "Texas' recent declaration of independence has left some wanting a new Governor (Or President as they call it). There are three major parties, the Democrats, that have had control over Texas in recent years. The Texas Independence Party, only barely holding on to power, and the Broad Progressive Party, a splinter faction of the Democrats. The Democrats are split in leadership, between Wilbert Lee 'Pappy' O'Daniel, and former U.S Presidential nominee John Garner"
TXS.14.a:0 "Allred holds on to power"
TXS.14.b:0 "O'Daniel's Democrats win"
TXS.14.c:0 "Garner's Democrats win"
TXS.14.d:0 "L.B.J's Progressives win"

TXS.15.t:0 "The New Government"
TXS.15.d:0 "Texas has now come under the management of the Central Government in Chicago. And, by order of Bill Haywood, a council of Trade Unions in Texas is to be assembled. This committee though, is weak and disorganized. Using mess halls and airplane hangars as meeting places. This move, is clearly one to weaken the faction of the SPA that strives for Texan Independence and Neutrality"
TXS.15.a:0 "Let’s hope this works out"

TXS.16.t:0 "An unfortunate series of events"
TXS.16.d:0 "Texaco has enjoyed a Monopoly on Texas' oil, one that they would stop at nothing to maintain. Unfortunately, insiders in the President's cabinet have informed us that they plan to split up our Company. This is unfortunate for them, as we have to have the cabinet removed"
TXS.16.a:0 "The President must be replaced"

TXS.17.t:0 "Buying the Police"
TXS.17.d:0 "The Police are a vital asset in controlling the Nation. Several local Police Chiefs are already in our pocket, but the Federal and National Police are still not swayed. They all need to be under our influence"
TXS.17.a:0 "You can't buy us!"
TXS.17.b:0 "A crisp $$100 bill will change their minds"

TXS.18.t:0 "Buying the Army"
TXS.18.d:0 "The Army is a vital asset in controlling the Nation. Several local Colonels and Garrison Commanders are already in our pocket, but the National Army is still not swayed. They all need to be under our influence"
TXS.18.a:0 "You can't buy us!"
TXS.18.b:0 "A crisp $100 bill will change their minds"

TXS.19.t:0 "The Coup of Executives"
TXS.19.d:0 "The Planning is finished, the coup is underway. The Texan Capitol was shook to it's core, when the Federal Police stormed the building. Executives were seen sitting in the chairs of prominent Cabinet Members, and Torklid Rieber was seen sitting in the President's chair. Lawmakers, as well as cabinet members and legislators were dragged out and arrested. A committee was assembled in the absence of the President, one owned by Texaco"
TXS.19.b:0 "A new dawn for Texas"

TXS.20.t:0 "Out from the Shadows?"
TXS.20.d:0 "“Texaco has saved the State of Texas from Syndicalist Tyranny”- were the opening lines from council-president Torklid Rieber. As the final meeting of the National Committee of State took place, the grip that Texaco held over the state has now become completely public, and Rieber has the power to declare himself as President. Of course, he could keep the rule of Texaco in the shadows and replace the “Shotgun Regency” with a body that is a bit more secretive. "
TXS.20.a:0 "Keep a facade council"
TXS.20.b:0 "Proclaim Rieber President!"

TXS.21.t:0 "Texas seeks to join the Entente"
TXS.21.d:0 "An envoy from the Second Republic of Texas has arrived in Ottawa today to discuss the prospects of their republic joining the Entente. Should we let them in or do we not need them?"
TXS.21.a:0 "Let them in."
TXS.21.b:0 "We don't need them."

TXS.22.t:0 "The Entente Accepts"
TXS.22.d:0 "The Canadians have accepted our offer and we are now members of the Entente."
TXS.22.a:0 "Excellent."

TXS.23.t:0 "The Entente Refuses"
TXS.23.d:0 "The Canadians have rejected our offer and refused our entry into the Entente."
TXS.23.a:0 "Damn Canadians."

TXS.24.t:0 "Texas to Join the Reichspakt"
TXS.24.d:0 "An envoy from Texas has arrived in Berlin today to discuss the prospects of their nation joining the Reichspakt. Should we let them in or do we not need them?"
TXS.24.a:0 "Let them in."
TXS.24.b:0 "We don't need them."

TXS.25.t:0 "Germany Accepts"
TXS.25.d:0 "The Germans have accepted our offer and we are now members of the Reichspakt."
TXS.25.a:0 "Great!"

TXS.26.t:0 "Germany Refuses"
TXS.26.d:0 "The Germans have rejected our offer and refused our entry into the Reichspakt."
TXS.26.a:0 "Damn Germans."

TXS.27.t:0 "Texas seeks to align with France"
TXS.27.d:0 "An envoy from Texas has arrived in Paris today to discuss the prospects of their nation joining the Internationale. Should we let them in or do we not need them?"
TXS.27.a:0 "Let them in."
TXS.27.b:0 "We don't need them."

TXS.28.t:0 "France Accepts"
TXS.28.d:0 "The French have accepted our offer and we are now members of the Internationale."
TXS.28.a:0 "Great!"

TXS.29.t:0 "France Refuses"
TXS.29.d:0 "The French have rejected our offer and refused our entry into the Internationale."
TXS.29.a:0 "Damn Frenchies."

TXS.30.t:0 "America is United"
TXS.30.d:0 "Despite everyone doubting us, we have triumphed. Texas has defeated all opponents. Haywood, Long, and MacArthur all stand vanquished, their lands being administered by the Lone Star State. We have finally United the States of America, under our banner"
TXS.30.a:0 "And they said it was impossible"

TXS.31.t:0 "All Factions Accept Texan Independence"
TXS.31.d:0 "With the infighting, and the chaos surrounding the Second American Civil War, no faction wants to go through the pain of invading us. In a conference today, leaders from the Combined Syndicates, the Union State, the Constitutionalists and the U.S have meet, and unilaterally accepted our independence"
TXS.31.a:0 "We're glad that this is settled"

TXS.32.t:0 "The Second Republic"
TXS.32.d:0 "Texas regaining its independence was not something that most suspected. But, something that the world needs to remember: Texas always puts Texas' Interests first. Texas will always be loyal to Texas and the Texan People. That is why we are called the Lone Star State. So remember this, remember how the government failed us, remember them putting their own selfish interests in front of us. We made the grave mistake of joining the pitiful union back in the 1840's, and we are determined to never make that same mistake again. TEXAS FOREVER! "
TXS.32.a:0 "...There's a Yellow Rose in Texas..."

TXS.33.t:0 "The Most Decorated Soldier"
TXS.33.d:0 "It has recently come to the President’s attention that a young man by the name of Audie Murphy has received more medals for valour, bravery, and just being an all around Syndie-killing, AFP destroying machine. After a rampage, where Murphy fought off a platoon almost twice the size of his on, won, and with nothing but a pistol and managed to take 135 prisoners, His General Claire Lee Chenault, recommended the Second Lieutenant for the position of General"
TXS.33.a:0 "To Hell and Back..."

TXS.34.t:0 "Loyalty to the U.S"
TXS.34.d:0 "The United States is the best option to survive in the harsh world of the Second American Civil War. If we are loyal to the U.S, then maybe we can keep our independence"
TXS.34.a:0 "The Union Forever!"

TXS.35.t:0 "Loyalty to the Union State"
TXS.35.d:0 "The Union State is the best option to survive in the harsh world of the Second American Civil War. If we are loyal to the Union, then maybe we can keep our independence"
TXS.35.a:0 "Every Man A King!"

TXS.36.t:0 "Loyalty to the CSA"
TXS.36.d:0 "The CSA is the best option to survive in the harsh world of the Second American Civil War. If we are loyal to the CSA, then maybe we can keep our independence"
TXS.36.a:0 "Solidarity Forever!"

TXS.37.t:0 "Loyalty to the PSA"
TXS.37.d:0 "The Pacific is the best option to survive in the harsh world of the Second American Civil War. If we are loyal to the Pacific States, then maybe we can keep our independence"
TXS.37.a:0 "The Star Spangled Banner, forever shall wave!"

TXS.370.t:0 "Loyalty to the CAR"
TXS.370.d:0 "The Constitutionalists are the best option to survive in the harsh world of the Second American Civil War. If we are loyal to the Constitutional States, then maybe we can keep our independence"
TXS.370.a:0 "For Dixieland we take our stand!"

TXS.38.t:0 "Corporate Soldiers"
TXS.38.d:0 "The Army has changed in recent years. The process of recruitment and conscription has ended, and now Texas' army is made up almost entirely of Texaco Private Security, and hired contract workers. No longer do we need to worry about numbers, all we need to do is fork over some cash, and a division of infantry appear at our front doorstep!"
TXS.38.a:0 "That's the way to go"
TXS.38.b:0 "This is a bad idea"

TXS.39.t:0 "Corporate Legions"
TXS.39.d:0 "The public aspect of our army has disappeared. No Texan needs to spill blood over our wars, only the blood of hired contract soldiers. And in recent years, the mostly inexperienced Contract troops have grown in skill. We have also reached into the Black Market, picking up some of the deadliest and experienced soldiers alive. Skilled mercenaries, Contract Assassins, killers and madmen that bend to our every will, and instead of serving criminals, now serve Texas"
TXS.39.a:0 "Wonderful..."

TXS.40.t:0 "Allies in Low Places"
TXS.40.d:0 "The Legal oil market can only gain us so many customers, real profit is to be made underground.  Mobsters need gas just as much as anyone else, and they are willing to pay top dollar to keep their operations secret. Luckily, we can supply them with gas and keep quiet about it, but it is going to cost them a few extra bucks. "
TXS.40.a:0 "Worth the extra penny..."

TXS.41.t:0 "Looking to the West"
TXS.41.d:0 "The American Union State has always been a thorn in our side, and Huey Long has always denounced our practices. At the moment they can do little to stop us, however it could always be useful to take him down. Currently Long’s main opponent is the reactionary Constitutional American Republic, a nation that we have a complicated relationship with. At the moment the “Fordist” National-Corporatist wing of the ODP is in support of our state, yet the NDWL has furiously denounced us due to our policies of “Allowing blacks into the government if they can afford it” and our takedown of the Dallas Klan. But, it seems that supporting them could help give Long an early funeral. "
TXS.41.a:0 "Why not, they are good customers!"
TXS.41.b:0 "We aren't monsters"

TXS.42.t:0 "Mexican Raids"
TXS.42.d:0 "Mexico has long challenged our independence, however recently Mexico has been challenging it through more violent means. Gangs of bandits and gunslingers tied to the infamous Pancho Villa have conducted many raids on the southern portion of our nation, burning Oil Wells and damaging our infrastructure. While the government officially disavows such actions, there is solid evidence that they are supporting these raids to weaken our economy and military. "
TXS.42.a:0 "Next time, bring the Tanks."

TXS.43.t:0 "A Challenge"
TXS.43.d:0 "Before Wilbert Lee O'Daniel was President of Texas, he was an influential figure in the music industry, something not forgotten by most Texans. One of the most vocal critics of O'Daniel, is the SPTX leader, Woodie Guthrie, is also a musician, and has been quick to criticize O’Daniel about his singing abilitie. In a rant about O'Daniel, Guthrie mentioned how O'Daniel 'Couldn't sing', and that all of his songs painted a picture of Texas that was ‘not kind to working folk’. Later on, President O’Daniel responded to these criticisms, saying that if Guthrie could sing better then he should ding it to my face. As the feud continued, a so-called “Sing-Off” was planned between the two politicians. "
TXS.43.a:0 "Exciting"

TXS.44.t:0 "A Sing-Off"
TXS.44.d:0 "Guthrie and O'Daniel met in a Houston theater, surrounded by the crowd eager to hear their performances. Rumors told that John Garner was in attendance of the show, but we can't be sure. Before Guthrie started playing, he said loudly that 'This Machine Breaks Chains' while raising his guitar in the air, before playing some of his most famous songs. After Guthrie's round ended, O'Daniel responded by playing one of his classic songs (Beautiful Texas). At the end, Guthrie and O'Daniel shook hands, before both singing the crowd favourite, The Yellow Rose of Texas (Even though Guthrie changed it to "The Red Rose of Texas" on more than one occasion)"
TXS.44.a:0 "It was a good show"

TXS.45.t:0 "The Cult of Cactus Jack"

Some of the more notable moments in the transcripts had Johnson Saying – “ Yeah. Now, another thing: the crotch, down where your nuts hang, is always a little too tight. So, when you make them up, give me a inch that I can let out there, because they cut me. They're just like riding a wire fence.

So leave me . . .You never do have much margin there, but see if you can't leave me about an inch from where the zipper ends around under my—back to my bunghole.”\n\n For a few day the public had a laugh at the transcript, while the President issues no comment."

His Texan Independence Party gained much traction during the Bleeding Texas Crisis, however it lost significant momentum following Texas declaring independence, as the Texan Democrat Party re-surged. But it appears that President Allred will rule for another day, remaining the President of the Reborn Republic and keeping Texas a haven for Liberal Democracy in the chaos of the American Civil War.

His Party was formed from more radical leftists who were too moderate for Allred’s mainstream left. Many in this coalition are further left than Johnson, though they so far hold little sway. Johnson’s grip on power is fragile, as his party only holds on to the government by the skin of their teeth. To stay in Power Johnson may even have to make deals with more radical Socialist subsets of the party. But for now, Johnson and his Vice-President Ralph Yarborough are focusing on brining Equality to Texas, and breaking down old barriers such as segregation and Poll Taxes. "
