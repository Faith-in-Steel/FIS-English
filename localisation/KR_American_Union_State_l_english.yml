### Parties ###
TEX_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_radical_socialist_party:0 "Independent League"
TEX_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Independent League - An association aligned with the Social Patriots in the CSA, these radicals are aligned with radical farm groups and seek a class collaborative form of socialism."
TEX_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
TEX_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - Most of the former progressive Republicans have ended up in the Progressive Party which ran before the Civil War. Without a national organ to draw from, the National Progressives are gradually absorbing them and making them a sub-wing of their organization."
TEX_social_liberal_party:0 "National Progressive Party"
TEX_social_liberal_party_long:0 "National Progressive Party - Part of the Republican Party has collapsed into the National Progressive Party, a creation of the Wisconsin-based La Follete family and one of the few major challengers to Long's agenda, with the party claiming to be more progressive than populist."
TEX_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The liberal democrats in the region desire a reunion with the pro-democratic factions of America at once if possible, only agreeing to work with the AUS to stop more radical factions. That said they do pay more lip service to farmers relative to other wings of the liberal democrats throughout the nation."
TEX_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party in the region that operates legally have often had to made concessions to populist rhetoric but in practice largely work with the AUS out of fear of the Old Democrats, non-local big business and Socialists. Supportive of segregation, their support would likely wane if lip service was paid to race progressives."
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The America First Party is a populist-American broad tent made up of those who follow a laborist, patriotic ideology and also generally view left socialism as being unpatriotic or totalitarian. They stand in opposition to other progressives by their reliance on political machines, their Share the Wealth Plan, relative cultural conservatism, populist-messaging, party militias and, more than anything, their personalism based around Louisiana Governor and firebrand Huey Long. As such they preach an odd mixture of radicalism, populism and pragmatism in order to enact a pro-labor and pro-famer capitalist nation united around the American identity."
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_national_populist_party:0 "White Leagues"
TEX_national_populist_party_long:0 "White Leagues - The various White Leagues in our territory are unorganized paramilitary organizations cut off the central apparatus of the National Democratic White League. While some have chosen not to take an official side during the war, the vast majority have sympathies with the CAR. Some AUS activists believe we could appeal to them to stop them from actively attacking us while other would see them finished."

TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is progressive-populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation or progressivism in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is liberal populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is conservative populism which defends welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race conservatism."

TEX_christian_party:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party. United by populist proposals of patriotism, universal employment and a minimum income for full citizens, the CP differs from the AFP and NPP in the emphasis on its military wing, Pelley's writings, harsher attitude towards socialism, citizen referendums, more explicitly Christian-based welfare, stricter constitutionalism, cultural supremacism (including overt anti-Semitism), and Pelley's ward policy towards groups of people he views as unproductive. As such the group is unsurprisingly extremely divisive even with the populist AUS, not helped by its even more radical-wing of the party being even more overtly racialist as well openly authoritarian, with many unsure how far Pelley would go to appease them."
TEX_christian_party_auth:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_auth_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party.

TEX_national_populist_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League"
TEX_national_populist_catholic_party_long:0 "The Holy American League - Originally the Papal Militia sent by His Holiness to aid the Union State in the civil war, under the leadership of Philip Carroll the Militia has changed dramatically. Coined the Holy American League after the war, there is little the League does NOT do. Everything from building homes for the poor to training Catholics in the art of self defense. With the success of the New Gunpowder Plot, governing can be added to that list. Since coming power, the League has begun to implement Integralism throughout the American Union State. If the League can succeed in it's crusade to bring Political Catholicism to one of the most protestant nations on earth is a question that only God or time will be able to tell."

Over the years however, the Knights began to shift from only an insurance company to a Catholicism Advocacy Group. It was with the Holy American League's blessing that the Knights now take yet another role. The order has been militarized!

As America is now being more and more integrated with the Church, the Knight's oath now leads them to protect and serve our government, to the death if Our Lord wills it."

While the Anglicans and Secularists may scoff, the people of North and South America clamor for a return to Truth, for a return to Sanity, a return to Tradition. Just as Our Lord heard the cries of the Israelites enslaved in Egypt and sent Moses to free them, so has God heard the cry of the people of the Americas.

TEX_lighning_joe_idea_5_desc:0 "Lightning Joe believes we should concentrate our firepower on certain sections of the enemy forces, so that we can punch holes where they are weakest and sap their strength where they are strongest.

TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "Huey Long has done it! Populists, who have been sneered at or even ignored since their birth in Kansas, now reign supreme in the country. It is thanks to our new Washington, Huey Long, that this could be achieved. With Long at the helm, nothing is beyond our reach. We shall overcome poverty and make America the nation it was always meant to be. Every man a king!"
TEX_to_the_victor:0 "To the Victor"
TEX_to_the_victor_desc:0 "It is over. The enemies of the American People have been felled and we control their lands. It is time to take possession of the enemies military assets, placing the AFP in charge of these valuable resources. Our control over the states will set the groundwork for the political future of America."
TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Despite their armies being defeated, extremists still populate the American states we have brought justice to. We need to root out those whom will never be satisfied with democracy under Huey Long, namely the militant cells that threaten the American populace at every turn."
TEX_reconcile_the_left:0 "Reconcile the Left"
TEX_reconcile_the_left_desc:0 "We can never excuse the CSA's attempt to overthrow the American Constitution or their embrace of anti-American syndicalism, but the grievances of the workers that were fooled into supporting them are fair. We should appeal to the Independent Leagues and AFL, whom desire economic reform. We know they wanted to work with Huey even before the war, but the most extreme radicals made a ceasefire the best offer we could provide. We will now bleed support from these same radicals."
TEX_afp_alone:0 "AFP Alone"
TEX_afp_alone_desc:0 "Compromise. That was the word used by useless politicians who nearly handed our country over to extremists. The AFP and the nation more generally is not going to go out of its way to appeal to any of the factions that aligned themselves against the American Union State. If they so wish, let them repent and embrace Longist values on their own, but we will not compromise."
TEX_reconcile_the_right:0 "Reconcile the Right"
TEX_reconcile_the_right_desc:0 "There is no mistake that the political right made mistakes in supporting either the Feds or Murray. However their pro-American values and defense of capitalism against syndicalism is admirable. Besides, their machines are too large to hit head on. Instead, we should co-opt them with appeals to the cultural conservativism and anti-socialist populism, opening the way to taking the South."
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats:0 "Dismantle the Dixiecrats"
TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats_desc:0 "The right-wing Democrats have looked down on Huey Long since he was a lawyer defending the little man from corporations. Now they wish for us to allow their machines to thrive, despite their attempts on the Kingfish's life. Let's see if they are so smug when the radical DWL gets a taste of their own medicine and the regressive Southern machine is wholly replaced by a progressive one."
TEX_black_support:0 "Black Support"
TEX_black_support_desc:0 "With our desire to displace the Old Democrats in their entirety, we have gained a more positive reputation with the country's black population. While Huey has long been ambigious on Civil Rights issues, he has suddenly found himself more vocally supporting increased spending on black communities at the expense of the landed elites of the South, leading to a rapid increase in black AFP supporters."
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie:0 "Shake Hands with Dixie"
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie_desc:0 "The Old Democrats are finished on a national scale, but their machine in the South remains. The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat. While we will hunt down the irreconciable White Leagers, we should cut a deal with the Southern Democrats whom now look to us for protection, promising not to uproot them so long as they do not oppose Long."
TEX_a_new_solid_south:0 "A New Solid South"
TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democratic machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long. They are already making appeals to support him on the national level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy. So long as they weed out radical anti-Longists and pay their share, there is no need to further disrupt the South. They are now a reliable voting block and White League opposition is winding down."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring.

TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"

TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "Destroy the Klan"
TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards have finally been arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation are being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction, we have finally pacified the most extreme faction seeking to destroy the American First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system, which is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response, a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_the_american_progress:0 "The American Progress"
TEX_the_american_progress_desc:0 "The AFP newspaper has always been the The American Progress and there is no reason to stop that now. The American Progress will be expanded at once to spread the word.

TEX_veteran_benefits:0 "Veteran Benefits"
TEX_veteran_benefits_desc: "We will need to stay in the good graces of veterans who fought for the American Union State, maintaining their loyalty to the state in the process. We should increase veteran benefits via direct welfare and have the AFP open veteran auxillaries."
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive orders have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. The president is, however, incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is his promise to America."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."
TEX_peoples_commission:0 "People's Commission"
TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of Louisiana, the president has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission. The Peoples Commission is a nonpartisan forum for public discussion that will allow the AFP to directly communicate with the American people and hear issues that politicians will not report on."
TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "Every Man a King"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and was then lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. With our tax rates and public control of valuable utilities every family can be guaranteed to recieve a minimum guaranteed living income, finally ending poverty in the United States."
TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "For the Poor Man"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now the president has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $$2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time as the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
TEX_populist_education:0 "Education for the Masses"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation, there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life. However, they face a future no better than that of their parents without education. President Long has approved the bill Congress sped through to rebuild schools and reopen colleges for Americans in need."
TEX_wealth_ceiling:0 "Wealth Ceiling"
TEX_wealth_ceiling_desc:0 "Tycoons of industry have robbed our people for too long. In light of this, we have decided to implement a new wealth cap. This will allow for a fairer distribution of wealth, and it may even help our small businesses thrive. This will make the wealthy angry, but we welcome their hate." 
TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "Roadmap for the Future"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King will require a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself. Therefore, President Long has laid out a road-map to plan out spending for the next four years of his term and milestones that America should cross."
TEX_townsend_plan:0 "Townsend Plan"
TEX_townsend_plan_desc:0 "Francis Townsend's plan for ending old age poverty via a generous pension scheme has long been part of Long's platform and will now be enacted. A National Sales Tax will help fund the gift of 200 dollars to every retired person over 60, which they must spend within a month to stimulate the economy."
TEX_founders_legacy:0 "Legacy of Founders and Scripture"
TEX_founders_legacy_desc:0 "When our founders declared independence, it was from British Royalty, but now it is economic royalty we must battle. Vacation days for workers and nationalized railroads will empower the people while combating the economic barons."
TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha, Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans, which gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills, will be created."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual national income. Incomes are capped at $$1 million, and inheritances capped at $$5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls now show overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, the president has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives. Now President Long is ready to stop pulling his punches against the social resistance to Share the Wealth. We must use every measure possible to stop the boat of the nation from turning over."
TEX_commodity_controls:0 "Commodity Controls"
TEX_commodity_controls_desc:0 "The farmers of this nation have been squeezed for too long, despite their goods fueling the rest of America! We shall implement a new Department of Economics with stronger powers to take a pro-consumer and pro-farmer stance. It will start with nationalizing utility companies that took an anti-AUS stance and purchasing agricultural goods."
TEX_farm_subsidies:0 "Farm Subsidies"
TEX_farm_subsidies_desc:0 "We can save the common farmer with the proper injection of good old American cash. The government will now subsidize farmers so they will not lose money growing the goods America needs and double down on purchasing excess goods for stockpiling during prosperous times."
TEX_keynesian_economics:0 "Keynesian Economics"
TEX_keynesian_economics_desc:0 "The government must ensure the American people never again suffer as they did under the Great Depression. Hoover's inability to rescue the economy nearly destroyed the USA, so we will follow the lead of economic progressives in adopting the recommendations of John Maynard Keynes to use a looser fiscal policy as a tool to fight unemployment."
TEX_scientific_board:0 "Scientific Board"
TEX_scientific_board_desc:0 "The Farmer-Labor Political Federation and the AFP shall enter a symbiotic relationship in embracing scientific planning for basic utilities and commodities while rejecting the radicals desire to do this for other goods. A scientific planning committee will be created to aid the DoE in distributing utility goods and purchasing goods from farmers directly."
TEX_coops_plan:0 "Co-op Plan"
TEX_coops_plan_desc:0 "A popular concept in both wings of the AFP, farm coops allow for farmers to share their resources with one another. We will have experts organize both supply and market coops depending on region so they may improve their agricultural output and economic well-being before having the committee register farmers to a national credit cooperative."
TEX_radical_economics:0 "Labor Economics"
TEX_radical_economics_desc:0 "We can't keep relying on traditional economic systems to serve us if we keep them on life support. A true labor-friendly economy must be supported, with any unemployed citizen being able to register for a commonwealth job in which commonwealths will create production based on use. These will be traded with other commonwealths according to the calculations of the committee."
TEX_banks_for_america:0 "Banks for America"
TEX_banks_for_america_desc:0 "It is long past time to adopt the Popular Control Plan for banking! A Central Bank will be created that will have control over the banking industry, with a board of directors directly elected by the people. 'Officers' for local banks will likewise be directly elected to control for parts of their bank not directly regaulted by the Central Bank. The bankers will do what they are supposed to: run the banks, and nothing more, as the people decide the rest."
TEX_strike_oil:0 "Strike Oil"
TEX_strike_oil_desc:0 "We can finally strike down Standard Oil, a company that decided to side with MacArthur and Oligarchs over the people. Their control of oil will be nationalized and run by the American Oil Company, a public corporation, while other oil companies will be broken up and taxed accordingly by the justice system."
TEX_utility_regulation:0 "Accessible Utilities"
TEX_utility_regulation_desc:0 "For too long utility companies have sought to extort customers of needed goods. We must interject a mix of price setting and government buyouts to make utilities accessable to all, and to increase government representation in this sector."
TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "Perfect Democracy"

The President and the American people agree that the Constitution is now a document to build a more perfect democracy. The uninterrupted will of the American peoples as exerted by its leaders. Legislative elections and a less economically-influential justice system will be reimplemented as seperate entities from the executive branch."
### Pelley Path ###
TEX_christian_party_victory:0 "Christian Party Victory"
TEX_christian_party_victory_desc:0 "In an outcome that has shocked both the nation and onlookers abroad, Huey Long and the America First Party have lost the first elections in America since the conclusion of the civil war. William Dudley Pelley, chairman of the Christian Party and Chief of the Silver Legion, has won both a slim majority in congress and secured the highest office in the land."
TEX_defend_democracy:0 "Defend Democracy"
TEX_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Before his election, the President was called many things. A legionnaire, a syndicalist, a populist tyrant, and so much more. Yet he has always claimed to be dedicated to upholding the American republic and the values on which it was founded. We shall implement a judicial bill that will affirm our committment to trial by jury and the powers of the court, and increase penalties for corruption."
TEX_organize_new_elections:0 "Organize New Elections"
TEX_organize_new_elections_desc:0 "Despite the steady rebuilding of our great nation, some express concern that the AFP was more concerned with its own power than with restoring America. In a bid both to distance ourselves from Long and increase our own popularity it has been decided that the federal government will ensure proper oversight for all state-level elections and remove those who won their seats through legally dubious methods."
TEX_fight_the_terrorists:0 "Fight the Terrorists"
TEX_fight_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Despite the end of the civil war, fighting has not entirely ceased. Ideologues still cling to their beliefs and occasionally strike at us before slinking back into the shadows. President Pelley shall order law enforcement to begin a nationwide crackdown to root out these murderers. Further, the Silver Legion will be deployed to supplement their efforts. America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization. Once freed from the grip of Hoover and his gang of sycophants and given proper oversight, they will help ensure the wellbeing of the republic and the upholding of our great laws!"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "The SPA’s attempt to destroy our nation has cemented President Pelley's suspicions that these traitors cannot be allowed to legally spread their filth. Effective immediately, all Marxist, Syndicalist, Bolshevist, and other vocal revolutionary left groups will be considered seditious and effectively outlawed. Some may complain that this is deeply authoritarian, but sometimes such measures are needed."
TEX_political_rehabilitation:0 "Political Rehabilitation"
TEX_political_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Despite the inherent evil of their leaders, do we not see that the average syndicalist is simply a man who wishes to have bread on his table? Thus we will direct the Department of Justice to begin drafting lists of currently imprisoned (non-leading) radicals and offer them clemency in return for a renunciation of their former beliefs and a written statement to never again support such causes."
TEX_national_command_structure:0 "National Command Structure"
TEX_national_command_structure_desc:0 "Despite our recent political success, infighting is abundant within the Legion. Local commanders complain of inconsistent orders, accountants skim off the top, and desertion is increasingly commonplace. This is unacceptable and damaging, not only to the Legion, but to America as a whole. The President will call a meeting of top Silver Legionaries to formalize a better command system."
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety:0 "Build Silver Lodges"
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety_desc:0 "The Silver Lodges were a grand idea devised by Pelley and his top commanders before the Civil War. The idea would involve the Legion purchasing lands on which to build command centers, in-order to facilitate recruitment. With many Lodges destroyed in the fighting, we should further our commitment to the Legion and direct the treasury to allocate funds to units so that they may build new headquarters."
TEX_wrangle_congress:0 "Wrangle Congress"
TEX_wrangle_congress_desc:0 "Despite the Christian Party having won the election, President Pelley has still found our politicians to be a bickering and gridlocked sort. Whilst his legislation does pass, it often takes too much time and requires far too much politicking for Pelley's liking. The solution to this is clear; utilize the radio as our new platform and decry those shysters who would hold up America’s future for their petty games."
TEX_pdol:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
TEX_pdol_desc:0 "Pelley gained most of his following from his radical economic proposals and the time has come to begin implementing these grand ideas. This monumental effort will begin with a vast expansion of the Department of Labor: in each and every county across our nation, a DoL office will be opened. This will set the groundwork for a truly staggering effort to transform the American economy."
TEX_universal_jobs_registry:0 "Universal Jobs Registry"

TEX_new_gunpowder_plot_desc:0 "We used to think that Long was on our side, fighting for our values, but after his reforms where he has tried to squash and remove us, we had to do something. In our time of need we were given a leader to rally behind, one who would save us and our values. After a cunning plan devised by our leader, we were able to get rid of Long and his lackeys in a single moment.

This has led to our Military Officers planning a cunning plan to destroy this heretical group once and for all!"
TEX_puppet_the_opposition:0 "Puppet the Opposition"
TEX_puppet_the_opposition_desc:0 "When Regent Carroll first assumed control over the American Union State, he single handily transformed the corrupt and heretical republican nation into a constitutional monarchy with himself as regent. However, he made the mistake of allowing those in opposition to the Holy American League to remain not only legalized, but within the halls of congress. However, a solution to this problem has finally materialized! By applying pressure via the Knights of Columbus and empowering the right people, we can effectively puppet the opposition. Not only will this give us an even more free hand in our righteous reconstruction of America, but when the people see us working side by side with those who oppose our rule, our popularity among them can only increase, a win-win situation."
TEX_cremate_the_klan:0 "Cremate the Klan"
TEX_cremate_the_klan_desc:0 "The Klu Klux Klan has been a stain on America since its creation. It is a travesty such a group exists in Christ's Kingdom in the first place.

TEX_catholic_monarchy:0 "The Maccabee Plan"
TEX_catholic_monarchy_desc:0 "To expand our faith and enact our plans, we need conversions and for conversions we need monetary aid.

TEX_catholic_education:0 "Catholic Education"
TEX_catholic_education_desc:0 "Public Schools have been the standard for common education since its inception.

Introspection into the secrets of Christianity and Catholicism will stop Orangeist thought."
TEX_cavalier_identity:0 "Cavalier Identity"
TEX_cavalier_identity_desc:0 "America was once a dominion of the British Empire which has spread the vile Anglican Faith across the world. However before Britain was completely overtaken by the satanic tendrils of Protestantism, she suffered a horrid Civil War between those who stood for God, King and Country and those evil men who had allowed themselves to be corrupted by Protestantism and the so-called Enlightenment. Those who fought for the King and his attempts to allow the free exercise of The One True Faith overtime adopted the term Cavalier to describe themselves. The Cavalier Identity, one of gentlemanly conduct, standing for God and Country, is an identity that our government must push the American people to adopt. By extolling these men as heroes, not only can we begin the process of creating a true cavalier identity among our people, we can also paint the Canadians and their royalist exiles as usurpers, giving both the American Revolution and our instating of a Monarchy more legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

Al Smith on the other hand has outlined his “Christian Capitalism” plan, which is exactly what it sounds like, this plan has garnered support as well but has been compared to the vile Liberalism that destroyed old America.

TEX_blur_the_lines:0 "Blur the Lines"
TEX_blur_the_lines_desc:0 "The Separation of Church and State was perhaps the greatest crime of the so-called Enlightenment.

TEX_combat_ready_desc:0 "Through firearm exercises and combat hardening training, we can prepare our soliders not only for the terrain and orders, but to fight with the utmost tenacity.

TEX_independent_command_style:0 "Cavalry Reconnaissance"

TEX_minutemen_professionalism_desc:0 "The Minutemen can not hope to fend off the enemy if they are going to remain ragtag auxillaries of the AFP.

TEX_manuever_training:0 "Maneuver Excercises"

TEX_militia_empowerment_desc:0 "We can learn much from the militia tactics used by the AFP during the buildup period to the Civil War. Ambushes, defensive tactics, and attacking enemy supply lines while invigorating our troops with an aggressive and ruthless mentality will win us the day."

TEX_draft_for_america_desc:0 "We have recruited many for the populist Christian cause, but some still refuse to join our ranks or do not qualify.

TEX_faith_and_fire_desc:0 "Our military has seen much growth, but some of the new recruits are not wholly convinced of the Minuteman cause. However where populism does not work, faith will.

TEX_gi_bill:0 "The G.I. Bill"

TEX_expand_ACTS:0 "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
TEX_expand_ACTS_desc:0 "We are lucky enough that the American Army in the past relegated air officer training to the deep South, as we now possess access to the instalations and officers from the Air Corps Tactical School in Maxwell Field, Alabama. However, in order to surpass the School set up in Langley Field in Virginia, we will need to expand on our instalations."
TEX_fighters:0 "Fighter Development"
TEX_fighters_desc:0 "American fighter projects were halted during the 1920s due to a lack of funding from the government, leading to a disadvantage in fighter development.

TEX_naval_bombers_desc:0 "With the shortcomings of our navy for protecting our shores, the air force has the duty to also protect the shores of our nation for whatever cost against any enemy who dare set foot in our homeland. As such, we will seek to complement the Navy's patrols with naval bombers scouting and intercepting any vessels whenever our fleet is too spread out or too far away to do so."
TEX_Weyland_plan:0 "Parsons Plan"

TEX_screaming_eagles_desc:0 "With the ever growing presence of our air force and ever growing needs of the battlefield, a question has arisen between our army and air force officers: Could it be possible to combine the two to transport troops behind the battlefield in a manner that may change the face of the battle? In order to prove or disprove this theory, an experiment shall be undertaken."

TEX_flexible_bombers:0 "Flexible Bomber Development"
TEX_flexible_bombers_desc:0 "Since our air force has the task of supporting the army, the bombers of our force will have to adapt to a variety of roles, both as close air support as well as disrupting enemy supplies and comunications in the rear during a battle and we should encourage the development of planes that may fulfil these roles."
TEX_combined_arms_offensive:0 "Combined Arms Offensive"
TEX_combined_arms_offensive_desc:0 "While our air officers stand at the ready, an issue has arisen once more that impedes the progress of our force: Army officers don't exactly know how to exploit our air power to its fullest potential.

TEX_long_range_interceptors_desc:0 "While fighters can secure the skies above the battlefields, the battle at the enemy's doorstep is usually too far away for them to step in to protect our bomber wings from the enemy fighters. To counter this, we have managed to create and improve heavier designs with longer to have bigger agility to stand a chance in air-to-air combat, and further investment in this area may yield great benefits."

TEX_back_in_business:0 "Back on the World Stage"
TEX_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that our position as a world power has been restored to us, it is time to figure out where we fit into the scheme of things. Most of our politicians, and people, are urging us towards isolationism. This would be simple, as it would mostly continue the foreign policy America had before the war. However, every isolationist is different, and some say it would be wise to seek allies in this changing world."
TEX_americanist_doctrine:0 "Americanist Doctrine"
TEX_americanist_doctrine_desc:0 "It would not serve us to isolate ourselves, as we have been in the past. At the same time, we will not play second fiddle to some other power.

TEX_popular_monroeism:0 "Review Monroeism"
TEX_popular_monroeism_desc:0 "During the Second Civil War, we largely abandoned our Monroe Doctrine obligations. Facing new threats, the countries of Latin America have turned inward, or to one another, for protection. We should pursue a new Monroe Doctrine, motivated not by greed, but by brotherhood. We are all Americans in a sense, and we will never suffer colonizers again!"
TEX_populist_alliance:0 "Populist Alliance"
TEX_populist_alliance_desc:0 "The old model of exploitation has been thrown out. Instead, we should win nations over with diplomacy, economic arrangements, and military protection.

TEX_internationale_non_agression_pact:0 "Internationale Peace Agreement"
TEX_internationale_non_agression_pact_desc:0 "Though we may not agree with the Internationale on everything, we share many goals.

We should pursue closer relations with these nations, and assure them that we will not act against them."
TEX_ideological_neutrality:0 "Ideological Neutrality"
TEX_ideological_neutrality_desc:0 "The ideologically-driven conflicts that are now commonplace in our world are worthless in our view. Why should we fight and die for the same things we fought a Civil War over? To what end? We have seen enough of such conflict, and we can't afford to renew tensions in our country over who we support."
TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism:0 "Oppose American Syndicalism"
TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is too extreme for our tastes. We should make sure that it does not become commonplace in the New World. We should target syndicalist nations in our hemisphere and suggest they either change course or, if they resist, face our intervention."
TEX_align_nationalists:0 "Align Nationalists"
TEX_align_nationalists_desc:0 "We should align ourselves with those who share our belief in nationalism.

TEX_denounce_oligarchs:0 "Denounce the War Racket"
TEX_denounce_oligarchs_desc:0 "Oil tycoons and automobile companies have begged us to start new wars abroad. Of course, this would be for their benefit, but not ours. We will not pay our corporations in the blood of our young people. War is a racket!"
TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists:0 "Investigate the War Lobby"
TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists_desc:0 "We are swarmed by lobbyists on a daily basis. Instead of letting these people get away with a slap on the wrist, why don't we investigate them? After all, these are the same people who sided with MacArthur in the war, and who knows who they might support in the future? They cannot be trusted. Put these traitors away."
TEX_break_war_mongerers:0 "Stop American War Mongerers"
TEX_break_war_mongerers_desc:0 "We've had enough of Canada intervening in our affairs. We have kicked the British out of our lands before, but if we are to commit to a new Monroe Doctrine, we have to go farther than that. What shall our next course of action towards them be?"
TEX_contain_hostile_leftism:0 "Strike Left Expansionists"
TEX_contain_hostile_leftism_desc:0 "When leftism goes too far, we must not be afraid to stop it in its tracks. Aggressive left-wing regimes now drown out the more peaceful ones and have significantly drive up world tension. We should act to stop them before it is too late."
TEX_end_carles:0 "Liberate Carlesian Argentina"
TEX_end_carles_desc:0 "Argentina has great potential, but its people suffer under the boot of a dictator. They did not choose him, and he has not given them their proper respect as a leader. We should do all we can to liberate Argentina from under his thumb, and perhaps create a powerful ally in the process."
TEX_break_militarists:0 "Break Militarist Aggressors"
TEX_break_militarists_desc:0 "We will attack ultra-nationalist regimes in our backyard, regimes that have caused endless violence and suffering for the people of the New World.

TEX_friendship_in_the_americas:0 "Independence of the Americas"
TEX_friendship_in_the_americas_desc:0 "The time has finally come: the Americas are free! Five hundred years ago, Europeans arrived on our shores and began centuries of domination. Now, we can confidently say that it is the end of an era. We should ally ourselves with the other nations of our hemisphere, so that we can stop the Europeans, or anyone else for that matter, from dominating us again."
TEX_mutual_trade:0 "Mutual Trade"
TEX_mutual_trade_desc:0 "We have no wishes to dominate the nations of Latin America. We want a true brotherhood with these countries.

TEX_research_agreement:0 "Research Initiative"
TEX_research_agreement_desc:0 "We should pursue new technological advances with the help of our new allies, and their resources. With their help, we can gain an edge on our European competitors, and become the most advanced nation in the world!"

TEX_Northern_boundary_defense:0 "Northern Boundary Defense"
TEX_Northern_boundary_defense_desc:0 "The first step in our defence must be to ensure our northern border is well-guarded. Canada and the other members of the Entente decided to involve themselves in our Civil War, despite it being none of their business. How can we be sure they won't intervene again? We should be ready for any move they could make."
TEX_man_the_walls_desc:0 "The first step in our defence must be to ensure our walls are well-guarded. The world should fear American military might, but only if they choose to engage us."
TEX_naval_prominence:0 "Naval Prominence"
TEX_naval_prominence_desc:0 "Though we controlled the Great American Plains during the Civil War, we shouldn't forget Texas. Having access to the sea was a blessing and a curse during the war, but now that we have won, we need to make sure we have a large navy.

TEX_defensive_doctrine:0 "Defensive Military Tactics"
TEX_defensive_doctrine_desc:0 "We should never forget 1812, when foreign invaders burned our capital to the ground. If we want to prevent this from happening again, we should make sure we can defend out country at all costs. No invader will ever reach our capital again, and those bold, or foolish, enough to set foot on our soil will be thrown back."
TEX_aid_paraguay:0 "Favor Paraguay"
TEX_aid_paraguay_desc:0 "As strange as it may sound, Paraguay was one of our closest allies in the Civil War. We should return the favor and aid them in their time of need. The fact that they are surrounded by larger and more powerful neighbors is not lost on us, and we will have to do everything we can to ensure they retain their independence."
TEX_business_of_neutrality:0 "Pragmatic Trade"
TEX_business_of_neutrality_desc:0 "Neutrality has its benefit in that our enemies are few, and thus our trading partners plentiful. If America is to build itself into a true world power, we must do so on the back of the mighty American dollar."

The most common name floated up is General Terry de la Mesa Allen Jr, although he would need to pressured into the position given his hatred of bureaucracy. Right-wing Longists that Gerald L.K.

A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capital, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control.

The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses.

unionstate.27.d:0 "While crime in rampant throughout the territory as criminals look to make a easy buck from the unstable nature of America one criminal group in particular has gained infamy, namely the Barrow gang. This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing. Famously Clyde Barrow himself carries a Browning Automatic Rifle. Unfortunately the gang is gaining an undeserved folksy reputation and undermining the legitimacy of the state, how should we respond?"

Nonetheless, he is not very welcoming towards the COnstitutional American Republic whom hope to displace him and his system with the Old Democrats and other more hardcore white supremacists and prohibitionists whom view Pendergast as a seller of vice which in all honesty he is. Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"

unionstate.29.d:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union is a left-wing bureau for tenant farmers legally operating within our territory and supporting the American Union State over the rightist Constitutional American Republic, whom are repressing the STFU in their territory. This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory. Providing support will surely help us shore up support but nonetheless would increase socialist sympathies and anger social conservatives who dislike the STFU's progressive stance on race issues."

unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Long's style of populism and alleged demagoguery. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the Constitutional American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
unionstate.3001.a:0 "Let them in"

unionstate.3002.t:0 "The Old Regulars"
unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisian's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."
unionstate.3002.a:0 "Cede part of Louisiana"
unionstate.3002.b:0 "Investigate them"

unionstate.3003.t:0 "Black Troop Debate!"
unionstate.3003.d:0 "The question of black combat troops has long been a contentious one in the United States, with race traditionalists insisting that blacks lack the intellectual faculties to be combat troops whereas others insist this is an absurd position and simply robs us of much needed soldiers. Currently Gerald L.K. Smith leads the charge on behalf of race traditionalists, insisting that blacks can not be expected to be soldiers and gain the same benefits as white soldiers. Charles Coughlin and much the Silver Legion are in accordance with this, although Pelley himself is ambivalent about letting Northern Blacks join as combat troops he is a hardliner when it comes to Southern Blacks, insisting they lack the 'intelligence and civility' to be troops. On the other side, Jacob Devers, the AFP machine in Louisiana and the Radicals in the AUS such as the Non-Partisan League, have pushed for black combat troops, admonishing the traditionalists for wanting to choose defeat just to spite blacks. They insist we should have Devers lead a recruitment campaign."
unionstate.3003.a:0 "We need black troops"
unionstate.3003.b:0 "We can not allow it"

unionstate.3004.t:0 "Minneapolis Syndicalists Strike!"
unionstate.3004.d:0 "While the state of Minnesota is in the control of the farmer-labor party, there remains a strong IWW element within Minneapolis whom have grown increasingly unstable since former governor Floyd Olson, whom held amicable relations with them, died. Now they are clearly desiring to join the CSA, and putting down their strikes would not only antagonize the socialists but cost us some manpower. Either we will have to pay them off of send national guard to quell them. Of course some radicals in the AFP would prefer to just give them semi-autonomy in part Minneapolis, allowing them to run it along more syndicalist lines so long as they do not attack members of the middle and upper class living there, and instead we will pay off business owners. They claim this will quell their anger altogether."

unionstate.3005.t:0 "Silver Legion Grows"
unionstate.3005.d:0 "For conservatives who are dissapointed in the Democratic Party for their lack of populist credentials compared to other factions but who are also turned off by the AFP's and NPP's progressivism, the Silver Legion's mix of conservatism and wealth redistribution has become an increasingly attractive alternative. The Democrats are becoming increasingly unpopular among the farmers and 'legacy' democrats who supported them before and are increasingly a party of tradesmen and some middle-class iberals based largely out of Texas."

unionstate.3006.t:0 "Leander Perez Controversy!"
unionstate.3006.d:0 "Leander Perez is an openly corrupt judge, hardline segregationalist and political boss operating out of Louisiana whom has made an alliance of pragmatism with Huey Long. Recently he has found himself in a controversy as journalists working for our political opponents have discovered his mishandling of oil leases under his watch, handing out contracts for bribes or to companies he ownes. Perez is a powerful ally but his handling of the oil contracts is forcing us to take a stand on this. Of course, this could be an opportunity to get rid of Perez, especially since in the future he will likely cause problems if we stray from his vision."

What should we do?"
unionstate.3007.a:0 "Pay him off"
unionstate.3007.b:0 "Get rid of him"

unionstate.3008.t:0 "Leander Perez Kidnapped!"
unionstate.3008.d:0 "Leander Perez has recently disappeared after a falling out with Huey Long. According to reports, the fight was over his position as district attorney within Louisiana and his diversion of funds Long wanted to fund the war effort. He was apparently ambushed exiting a courthouse and entering his car, after which whomever was already in the car and the driver kidnapped him. Why his bodyguards did not intervene is unknown but while Long has blamed the dissappearance on socialists most don't doubt that Perez is in a swamp somewhere. With an example made, we could allow the machine he set up to go back to its usual business or we could appoint one of our own, which may be useful if we do not plan to follow the right-wing agenda of the Perez machine, with Cat Doucet being floated as an AFP representative who can take the plce of Perez and reform his machine to be more in-line with our values."

Their gambled failed however, and while they have fled the nation we have taken control of their businesses left here in the states. For the large stockholders, we will have to decide if we should wholly take control of these businesses, and sell them to someone new, or allow them to retake control under new corporate leadership so long as they pay fines."

The Black Legion has decied this as a war crime, claiming that Effinger was not only given no chance to surrender but that Black Legion watchmen were killed before they could issue a warning, meaning the Minutemen had no intention of giving them a chance to surrender. However the operation is being celebrated across America and Ranger Manuel T.

There is Richard Russell Jr, who was a known moderate during the war and one of the more reluctant members of CAR, openly hoping they would shift closer to the center, however he is somewhat too socially conservative for many. Then there is James Eastland, who is more hardline on race issues but far more open to Long's economic agenda. Finally, we could pull some strings to place Earl Long in charge of the region."

unionstate.41.d:0 "The Dallas Klan is known for having had a a more ambiguous relationship with the National Klan and did not outright side with the CAR, saving itself from the state crackdowns that destroyed or damaged other Klans in the American Union State. However, with our embrace of the black vote they seem to think they have made a mistake, and have vandalized a local Share Our Wealth club, followed by sending threatening letters to black reverends now embracing Huey Long.

unionstate.42.t:0 "AFP Southern Leader"
unionstate.42.d:0 "As the AFP machine consumes the Southern Democrats and Old Democrats machines we will need to entrust a leader to oversee that our sympathizers, including black voters, are put on the voting rolls there. We could place longtime loyalist Rush Limbaugh Sr, who lead the AFP in the region throughout the war in the region, in charge. Another choice is Civil War veteran and AFP rising star Sid McMath.

My First One Hundred Days is a film about Huey Long's first 100 Days after winning the America Civil War and bringing peace and prosperity to the United States, as directed by Gregory La Cava. With an opening with the actual Huey Long endorsing the film and wishing all Americans well, critics claim that the film being funded by the AFP makes it little more than a piece of government propaganda. Nonetheless, it is popular with Americans looking for an optimistic view of the nation, a promise of unity and a leader who will protect them."
unionstate.44.a:0 "Very Good!"

unionstate.45.t:0 "Fate of Standard Oil"
unionstate.45.d:0 "With Standard Oil coming under our control, we have decided to keep the oil in Louisiana under government control. However the fate of the rest of our national reserves has come under debate, with some wanting us to break up Standard Oil into many companies and the US government simply owning a share of it while hardliners in the AFP would prefer if we just keep the oil nationalized and use the funds towards national projects."

unionstate.46.t:0 "Power of Congress"
unionstate.46.d:0 "Huey Long has made it clear that he will not leave the White House unless it's in a box, signing executive acts that expands his powers and declaring the AFP a government organization that is now virtually unchallengeable and has full control over voter rolls for the Presidential elections, with the army now lower ranking than the Minutemen politically speaking. Congress is another issue however, and some AFP members claim legitimate opposition should be allowed to exist there and in the Supreme Court. The Protect America Act put forward by hardliners and backed by the Louisiana machine and Townsend would effectively give the president full legislative and judicial power, and all him to remove troublesome congressmen from power, although this would drop all pretense of national democracy even if local elections and interaction with the government through town councils and party machines continue to exist."

unionstate.47.d:0 "The Protect America Act has caused a wave of protests throughout the nation in opposition to Long's new status as America's presidential dictator. Civil liberties advocates in the ACLU have organized the largest protests in Louisiana and D.C. as both symbolize the wedding of the AFP machine with the American Government. The AFP inner circle believe light intimidation tactics such as scaring critical journalists will be enough, although Earl Long would prefer we just outright break up the protests through the national guard."

Privately, the Archbishop desires increased funding for Catholic diocoses, for Long to endorse friendship with Catholic nations and for it to be easier to Catholic immigrants to become naturalized immigrants. However Coughlin supporters still in the AFP do not desire any such agreement, thinking Long should do it without their approval since they view the clericy with suspicion for not endorsing them sooner. However, the Archbishops promise increased support for Longism if he agrees."

ALready the treasury, IRS and interior ministry are reporting talk of moving out of the nation and are begging us to enact capital controls which would make it more difficult to leave the country. Two plans have been put forward, one that would set a limit on how much the wealthy can take abroad and another that would tax foreign investments and force those moving to a new country to pay a fee that absorb nearly all of their wealth behind, ensuring they most likely would not."

With the Vice-Presidency essentially being controlled by the AFP many want to simply select a new leader until the next election to help the nation heal from this loss, and there has been no shortage of infighting but the parties current position leaves only a handful able to take the position, with Earl Long competing with more ideological faction leaders for AFP and congressional support."

Allowing him to do so would allow the Long family to remain in power while also demonstrating Huey Long's willingness to give up power, even if it is conveniently to a family member.

### Pelley Events ###

unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"
unionstate.52.a:0 "Fortify it."
unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

unionstate.54.t:0 "Pelley Speech Attracts Controversy!"
unionstate.54.d:0 "During a controversial speech presidential candidate William Dudley Pelley endorsed what he has called the 'Ward System' for various groups labeled 'unproductive' which would ensure they do not receive full Commonwealth benefits until they are labeled as productive and would be relegated to largely labor jobs in the mean time. Naturally this has attracted a large amount of criticism while also appealing to former Democrats and racially conservative Republicans despite Pelley's claim the Ward System is 'radically different' from the ODP's Segregation platforms. Perhaps speaking out against it can increase our percent of the black and liberal votes, although it does threaten to drive away some voters."
unionstate.54.a:0 "Denounce the Speech"
unionstate.54.b:0 "Do nothing"

unionstate.55.t:0 "The Silver Cavalcade!"
unionstate.55.d:0 "With President Pelley having won a surprise electoral victory it has become clear that he needs to further his grassroots support if his most ambitious plans are to have any hope of succeeding. After several meetings with his advisors the President believes he has come up with the ideal plan for this, a nationwide barnstorming tour with members of the Christian Party and the Silver Legion. Seen live, broadcast both on radio and recorded to be shown after the fact, the Silver Cavalcade as it is now being called internally will surely spread our message further than ever before."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Fund it"
unionstate.55.b:0 "Actually, let's wait on this"

unionstate.56.t:0 "Jewish Segregation?"
unionstate.56.d:0 "As our platform is implemented more and more, one of the President's more controversial ideas has again reared its head. In Pelley’s mind the influence of the American Jewish population on both the capitalist and syndicalist systems and the growing population of politically aware Gentiles necessitates that they need to be stripped of certain rights for the time being, ostensibly for their own protection. Under the plan the Jewish population in each state would be moved to a single city until the Commonwealth system is fully implemented, at which time the President promises they will again receive full rights. Regardless of his promises though the idea has attracted outrage from a not insignificant portion of the population who claim it will lead to mass abuses and other rights violations, and on the other hand the hardliners in the Christian Party are demanding an immediate implementation of the plan. It seems like no matter what choice we make could cause us further problems in the future."
unionstate.56.a:0 "Implement it"
unionstate.56.b:0 "It's too controversial"

unionstate.57.t:0 "Our Problem Children"
unionstate.57.d:0 "In recent years the Christian Party has blossomed to become one of the largest in these United States, however this has not been without its own set of problems. Several elements of the Christian Party, particularly those in California, have taken their rhetoric far and beyond what the national leadership has. Led by Henry D. Allen's wing of the party as well as the increasingly controversial Gerald L.K. Smith it espouses radical racialist doctrines and promoting ideas such as the mass expulsion of Jews from the United States, these groups are increasingly harming the Presidents image and one way or another we need to make a choice on how to best handle the situation, with Willard Kemp offering to help reign them in via private conversations and threats of expulsion."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Do nothing"
unionstate.57.b:0 "Reign them in"

unionstate.58.t:0 "Slow growth of Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.d:0 "One of the more peculiar parts of President Pelley’s beliefs are his esoteric approach to Christianity. Known under several different names in prior years, Soulcraft Doctrine as it is now known has seen a slow but steady growth under the Pelley administration. Whilst the President has suspended any new publications on the matter to avoid First Amendment cases, prior works such as the Golden Scripts are being sold in higher numbers and more and more people seem open to exploring the President's ideas on not just politics and economics, but spirituality as well. Of course, this has also caused ridicule from papers such as the L.A. Times who mock Pelley as a 'guru', making many in the party reluctant to push the matter further."
unionstate.58.a:0 "Publish more Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.b:0 "A fine development"

unionstate.59.t:0 "Calling in Favors"
unionstate.59.d:0 "It is no secret that the President is the most powerful man in these United States, but even a powerful man at times has need for favors and assistance. In the years before he assumed the Presidency Pelley acquired a long list of contacts in several fields, particularly in finance, industry and politics, through his authorship followed by his leadership of the Silver Legion. Whilst our programs are being speedily implemented and the Chiefs vision of America becomes truer by the day it might be wise to call in these favors and outstanding debts, even if it might appear unpopular to the masses."
unionstate.59.a:0 "Of course"
unionstate.59.b:0 "No, it's corrupt"

unionstate.5900.t:0 "The Ward System"
unionstate.5900.d:0 "Due to his campaign promises, the Pelley administration is faced with a controversial idea that needs resolved. In the past, now President Pelley spoke of a system that in his eyes would allow the government to best help and uplift its most impoverished citizens. Known as the Ward System, the idea would see those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and be brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and would deny them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. While in theory the system would be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing some have expressed outrage and compared the idea to modern slavery. The President calls these claims outrageous and a step forward from the old Jim Crow system but a choice must be made on the matter immediately, with challenges by ACLU and NAACP lawyers as well as the opposition parties making the mainstream of the CP more reluctant to endorse it."
unionstate.5900.a:0 "Implement the Wards"
unionstate.5900.b:0 "No, we should step back"

unionstate.5901.t:0 "Cleansing Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.d:0 "Before entering the realms of either spirituality or politics, Pelley was a rather successful screenwriter for Hollywood and while he eventually grew disgusted with the industry and its supposed Syndicalist influence he has always maintained a fondness for the silver screen, and in turn it began to despise him. Recently the President organized a showing of several of the films he helped make in his heyday at the White House and afterwards he announced a number of executive orders seeking to cleanse Hollywood of any anti-American sentiments and sponsoring the opening of new studios so that Americans may once again enjoy cinema if Hollywood did not 'clean up its act' at once. Much of the right-wing of the CP is pushing for him to simply implement these policies now however and Pelley would prefer it that way, although many in the cabinet view it as too radical."
unionstate.5901.a:0 "Clean up Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.b:0 "We'll give them a chance"

unionstate.5902.t:0 "The First Americans"
unionstate.5902.d:0 "Is there any group more disadvantaged and stepped on in the modern United States than its original inhabitants? President Pelley certainly doesn’t think that’s the case, having for several years written about the plights of various Indian groups and peoples and the attempts by various groups to seize their lands or turn them to beliefs like Syndicalism in an effort to manipulate them. In a recent speech to Congress the President swore that these transgressions would end now and forever, promising to strengthen and strongly enforce the treaties the Federal Government has with the Indian Nations and ensure these groups have equal opportunities under the Commonwealth system."
unionstate.5902.a:0 "It was needed"

unionstate.5903.t:0 "Assassin strikes at Pelley!"
unionstate.5903.d:0 "While giving a speech in the Capital today, President William Dudley Pelley was fired at by a radical leftist maniac who tried killing the Chief with his revolver. The Crowd quickly was sent into a frenzy, and Silver Legion police quickly attempted to apprehend the Assassin before he could strike Pelley down. "
unionstate.5903.a:0 "The Would-be Assassin is Apprehended!"
unionstate.5903.b:0 "The Assassin strikes Pelley, but he lives!"

Now, Effinger and his top men are going to be tried by our government but the attorney general is asking us if we should pursue the death penalty or not? While some activists in our ranks would prefer to stick to our anti-death penalty stance most everyone else believes we should favor the death penalty. Since Effinger will absolutely be convicted this will decide his fate."

While initially costly to implement this is a widely popular event and has seen many Americans looking forward to a new America, and many unions among affected railroads viewing liberal reforms as superior to syndicalist policy."
unionstate.61.a:0 "Great"

unionstate.62.t:0 "Endorse Deweyism?"
unionstate.62.d:0 "John Dewey was a member of the social patriots in the CSA but who was sympathetic to us and repeatedly pushed for peace with the American Union State, and many of his adherents were among our own ranks as well. As such, his followers believe we should take the opportunity of refitting the education system to apply his theories of hands off teaching and self-learning to our schools, which they believe will better prepare our children to become citizens. Traditional teachers of course oppose the model."

unionstate.63.t:0 "Long criticizes the NPP!"
unionstate.63.d:0 "Huey Long has come out against 'sewer socialism', arguing that it does not go far enough to redistribute wealth while also leaving too much power in bureaucrats who do not represent the 'will of the people'. We have replied with accusations of Long's corruption but he has struck a chord among those who believe Long would have gone further to combat economic inequality although our economists believe it would have been for show."
unionstate.63.a:0 "Bastard!"

unionstate.64.t:0 "Black Support?"
unionstate.64.d:0 "The NAACP is petitioning us to make an effort to support black workers by removing racical barriers in being hired for our government programs and organizing them within our farmer-labor groupings. This has naturally caused ambivalance in the party despite many progressives favoring such measures, some are still nervous this could lead to a backlash and note that our black support during the election was not particularly high anyways."
unionstate.64.a:0 "Work with the NAACP"
unionstate.64.b:0 "We're not ready for that"

unionstate.65.t:0 "NPP absorbs the Farmer-Labor Party"
unionstate.65.d:0 "Concluding our negotiations with the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party and its leaders such as Elmer Austin Benson we have managed to finally make the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party a wing of the National Progressive Party! Shall we keep them a semi-autonomous force or push for them to be fully absorbed into the NPP?"
unionstate.65.a:0 "Absorb them"
unionstate.65.b:0 "Leave them some autonomy"

unionstate.66.t:0 "Large Contractors Offer Help"
unionstate.66.d:0 "While we promised to favor smaller contractors for our projects, the Kiewit Corporation has just made a very lucrative offer to help rebuilding Nebraska alongside our government. This would be much more efficient and quick than assembling many small contractors, and would see the state back on its feet in no time. However, Nebraska contractors would of course see this as a betrayal, even if we tried to have Kiewit work with them."

The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibiton Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."

The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within.

The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

This has come as a shock to the Long administration; it's been well known that America is a largely Protestant with the Catholic population, whilst large as well, mostly residing in the greater area of New England, some of them only living as far south as southern Maryland, all well out of the reach of the American Union State at present. While Huey Long personally would attribute this gesture to traditional Catholic virtues of charity and diligence, as most would, some among the upper echelons of the AUS supporters, particularly the devout protestant Gerald L. K. Smith, despise the notion of Roman Catholic intervention, urging Huey Long to refute any attempt by the Vatican to potentially expand their influence in North America, citing the Catholic unrest in Mexico as an example of the Papacy's 'corrosive attempt to uproot the values of the Free World'. While one can easily dismiss Smith's ravings as unfair and bigoted, the ultimate decision rests with Huey Long."

Crossing into the city over the river from Fort Armistead, under heavy fire, on ramshackle barges for most part with the aid of loyalist elements in the city, the Papal Militia landed at Sparrow's Point and rushed headlong into the teeth of the enemy resistance along the riverside, splitting their forces and cunningly using the cover of back alleyways and side streets, advancing inward as the main forces battled the enemy across the main boulevards and through city parks. At the crescendo of the fighting in the city, the Papal volunteers, in a display of near-suicidal bravery, at once advanced on the enemy forces entrenched on Gulford Avenue outside City Hall, the Militiamen, with the aid of a number of local volunteers, many of them African-American and many more of them from the white Catholic citizenry, charged the barricades, overwhelming the enemy combatants, causing many of them to simply break rank and flee, and while many militiamen lost their lives in the fighting, including the heroic sacrifice of the militia leader, Father Emilio Arandes, by mid day, the city had surrendered to Huey Long and the American Union State. While this proved to be a huge victory for both Long and the militia, some within the High Command were angry with impudence displayed by the militia, with an anonymous officer stating in private: "This war is our war, not their personal crusade""

Among those in attendance beside the memorials to Arandes, who heroically led the bayonet charge into city hall before being gunned down by separatist traitors, was a pious dignitary from among Maryland's Catholic elite. Philip Acosta Carroll, an army officer and an irreverently patriotic and deeply religious supporter of the Papal Volunteers who was the chief architect of the Longist resistance in Baltimore, Carroll has the distinction of being a direct descendant of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, known to history as one of America's Founding Fathers and as the only Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence, a man hailed as a hero as the principal financial supporter of the American Revolution, many American historians credit the institution of Freedom of Religion in the US constitution as a means of honoring the contribution of a Catholic man's diligence and charity to a largely Protestant country's war of independence. Now, hundreds of years after the American revolution, the United States stands at the forefront of another revolution, and it is here, as before, that Philip Carroll, like the Lord of Carrollton before him, has pledged himself to the American Union State and in accordance with recent communiques with the Vatican, Carroll has formally assumed leadership of the Papal Militia, ready to lead the Catholic faithful in America against the scourge of the Syndicalist and Stratocrat alike. This news has been met with an immense upswing in support, causing a massive swell in donations and volunteers for the American Union State, both for Huey long's Minutemen and the Carroll's Papal Militia."

To that end, the corps commander, Philip Acosta Carroll, along with a high-profile cabal of devout Catholics, both famous and notorious, from the American political theater, have announced the formation of the Holy American League, a non-profit organization dedicated to Catholic, christian values of charity and diligence and the American spirit. Within this new coalition, Carroll and his militia have surrounded themselves with a posse of political elite, one of the more well known figures being New York Governor Al Smith, the Brooklyn-born democrat credited with a reputation as a venerable elder statesmen and for his involvement in the construction of the Empire State Building, it is hoped that Smith's moderate reputation would help legitimize the League in the eyes of the Senate and Congress. In addition to Smith, among the founders of the League, most controversially, includes woman's suffrage activist and  known socialist sympathizer Dorothy Day, who is herself most known for her relationship with the likes of Big Bill Haywood, John Reed and the SPA, all avowed enemies of Huey Long and the American Union State, and while Long has been comparatively lenient in allowing Day to continue to operate in the continental United States, mostly due to her socialist tendencies mostly revolving around humanitarian activism and charity, which happen fall in line with Long's welfare policies, the League has still garnered a great deal of public criticism for Day's history with the CSA. Day's involvement might explain the strange absence of the loudest and most obvious supporter of American Catholics, and while Charles Coughlin himself was quite loud and ardent in his initial support of Carroll and the volunteers, the alignment with Day has turned Coughlin into the League's most scathing critic, verbally ripping apart the League on his radio show, stating loudly that he will oppose any measure that seeks to uproot the sanctity of American faith."

unionstate.305.d:0 "As the first step in the Holy American League's plan to aid in the reconstruction effort of the American Union State, Philip Acosta Carroll, in concert with Al Smith and Dorothy Day, began establishing humanitarian aid camps throughout the eastern seaboard. From Baltimore to Miami to Baton Rouge, the volunteers under Carroll and the League set about distributing food and water, providing medical aid and setting up hospital camps, religious services and education for children, helping to clear out rubble and repair the damage wrought by the fighting, and in the Deep South along the Black Belt, where the African American population were often subject to the most suffering and desolation from the war, many soon found themselves finding refuge with the Catholic volunteers, who piously and tirelessly labored to heal and rebuild the black communities damaged by the war, openly forsaking and condemning the racial violence suffered by the black minority in the Jim Crow South and fully embracing the unity of black and white Americans in solidarity and brotherhood. As one might imagine, this sentiment was not received well by the Dixiecrats of the American deep south political elite, who protested Huey Long's leniency with the League's sphere of influence spreading so far south, many of them beginning to align with Gerald L.K Smith's paranoid suspicion about the prevalence of the Catholic presence in the south, and even Charles Coughlin, despite his militant Anti-Klan stance, can't help but look at the League's increasing influence with African Americans without skepticism as to the validity of their intentions. Nonetheless, the efforts of the Holy American League have very much impressed Huey Long, who publicly praised the efforts of Philip Carroll and the League for helping to stitch America back together again."

unionstate.306.d:0 "Ever since the founding of the Holy American League, the efforts on their behalf of providing aid to destitute Americans, the League's militiamen and humanitarian workers have seen a huge increase in volunteers across America, with many New Englanders and African Americans in the Deep South flocking to the ranks of the League, more importantly, the increase in popularity of the League also coincides with an increase in religious conversions to Roman Catholicism throughout the American Union State, with many of the League's new volunteers often pledging themselves in a deeply pious and ceremonious fashion, in accordance with Catholic doctrine, some of them taking oaths of Abstinence, Poverty or Chasity in adherence with their newfound faith. Inevitably, this was going to lead to a confrontation with the far right Protestant majority in America, and now, spurred on by Gerald L. K. Smith's fear-mongering, increasingly frequent incidents of violence between the League and the far right protestant and evangelical population have been reported in the Deep South, indeed, much of the christian right in America are furious at what they see as the encroachment against traditional American christian values and espouse that the presence of the League, who the christian right decry as "Papists", are a conspiracy enacted by the Vatican to purge the continental United States of all who refuse to submit to Papal Autocracy. And through it all, as is unfortunately the case with American christendom, the violent, terroristic activity of the Ku Klux Klan has begun to rear it's ugly head once again.The white supremacists are preaching that the League's favoritism of the negro population is an obvious ploy to usurp the authority of the white man, and already, reports of vicious hate crimes and atrocities have begun to surface, some as far north of the Black Belt as Virginia. The situation appears to be rapidly spiraling out of control; many Huey Long's supporters among the Dixiecrats are complaining to the Kingfish personally about what they see as the League's arbitration, and even some members of the Minutemen were seen clashing with the League's militiamen. All of this presents a difficult dilemma to Huey Long, as much of his support is reliant on the conservative right in the South, and as such, the crisis must be handled with delicacy and tact. In other news, Charles Coughlin's weekly radio broadcasts have been postponed for undisclosed reasons."

unionstate.307.d:0 "With the current situation in the South becoming ever more tenuous, a meeting was called President Huey Long, Field Marshal Jacob L. Devers and christian conservative leader Gerald L. K. Smith, and amidst a storm of accusations, posturing and the pointing of fingers as to whom did or didn't do what, a solution arose to the issue of the Holy American League that seemed a far more extreme measure than Long had anticipated, and yet, it might be one of the better options available to him. Smith proposes an Anti-Catholic Bill, the beginning of a means to counter the influence of the growing Catholic influence on the population, as well as artificially limiting their influence within the American government, to be stream-rolled through Congress; Smith remains adamant that the League's modus operandi is to seize control of the American Union State and turn it into a puppet state loyal to no authority but the Holy See. While the Kingfish was quick to dismiss Smith's ramblings, Devers' concerns about Carroll and the League are much more realistic to to hear; Devers does, indeed agrees that it is unlikely that a conspiracy by the Vatican is ongoing, however, he points out, very matter-of-factly, that Carroll himself, from an outside perspective, seems to be positioning himself as a potential leader for the Catholic minority as well as the voice of minority rights of those oppressed largely by evangelical protestants in the South, namely African Americans, and combined with the alliance between Carroll, Al Smith and Dorothy Day, Devers postulates that, while maintaining that any sort of armed Coup D'état is unlikely,  Philip Carroll is possibly positioning himself to run for President to unseat Huey Long in the next election. Furthermore, even though Devers claims that the unrest in the South can be easily brought into line with some well-placed peace keeping forces, perhaps combined with Long applying pressure to convince Charles Coughlin to support the League to help foster better relations between the League and christian far right, it might also be in Long's interest to, if Carroll's influence is, indeed, growing, to consider passing the anti-catholic bill to ensure a comfortable majority in the polls."

Only a small contingent of military police sat outside the Capitol building, a small but unnecessary measure to ensure the safety of the Kingfish's entourage on arrival. Huey Long was there, Fox Connor was there, so was Gerald L. K. Smith, their purpose that night was to briefly oversee the deliberation over the new Anti-Catholic Bill being considered, arriving well ahead of the senators and congressmen to the senate chambers, and despite the eerie emptiness of the building once inside, Long's inner circle was certain that the night would conclude decisively. Their assumptions would be proven right. The last anyone saw of the Kingfish and his cabinet was in Smith's office, where the three men sat, laughing, joking, and drinking (except Smith, obviously.), cavalier at their impending success as they listened to the new broadcast of Charles Coughlin's radio show, the first one in a long while. Father Coughlin, who spoke with his trademark tone of a parent speaking to his children, spoke of the impending Bill that sought to curtail his faith, and in so doing, usurp the faith that defined not only his identity, but that of a large, and growing, minority of the country, and despite this, he spoke in a manner that was almost frighteningly calm. As his show for the night came to a close, the last words that came over the radio were: "And my wrath shall wax hot; I shall kill you with the sword, and you will find that your wives shall be widows and your children, fatherless." The Capital Building of the United States, the spitting image of American democratic values, then erupted in an inferno as crate after crate of high-grade explosives detonated in the sewers below. Long, Connor and Smith, and a scant number of the Minutemen, would be incinerated in the blast, the former seat of the United States Congress completely burnt to cinder as the military police looked on, awestruck. By tomorrow morning, coalition forces of both the Minutemen, under the command of Father Charles Coughlin, and the Holy American League, under the auspices of Philip Acosta Carroll, will have seized control of the White House just as similar elements consolidated power in Charleston, St. Louis and New Orleans, by that afternoon, radio communiques with Field Marshal Devers would affirm the peaceful transition of command of the armed forces to the administration of the coalition government of Carroll and Coughlin, and by evening, Philip Acosta Carroll would be sworn in as the new President of the American Union State."

unionstate.309.d:0 "With the collapse of the hegemony of Huey Long and his authoritarian clique of crypto-royalists, the question of what the Holy League's governmental reforms entail have begun to manifest, and it begs the question; did the question of an American Monarchy die with Huey Long, or does Carroll and the League have other plans? Many people, both at home and abroad, have drawn correlations between the Holy American League and the various other Nationalist Religious movements throughout the world; the Orthodox nationalists in Russia, the Vaterland Front in Austria, and of course, the Integralist movements in Portugal and Brazil. All of these movements contain similar values, despite their vast cultural differences; ardent, patriotic nationalism, a strong empathies on adherence to religious values (Christianity.), an intense antipathy for both syndicalism and liberalism, and in all of them, a desire for societal and cultural restructuring around the old world virtues and, in said countries, to ensconce the balance of power under the auspices of a monarchy; the Romanovs, the Braganza, and so forth. The prospect of the American people accepting a return to Empire is, to put it mildly, a high hurdle to surpass at best; even ignoring the well-known history of the nucleolus of the American Revolution being born from Imperialist exploitation and oppression, between the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, it has been shown that many Americans simply cannot and will no longer abide the abolition of individual rights or democracy in favor a strongman in the White House, Newburgh Letter or not. It is doubtful that Philip Carroll, given his family lineage and his religious faith, would ever seek any kind of subservient accommodation with the royalists to our north, and certainly not after the debacle in mainland Britain. At the same time, however, Long, MacArthur and Carroll proved that one man's strongman can be another man's savior."

unionstate.310.d:0 "In what many Americans were left dumbfounded today by a stunning joint declaration by President Philip Acosta Carroll, Father Charles Coughlin and the Holy American League announcing that the American Union State would, indeed, be transitioning to a form of constitutional monarchy. The astonishment of the majority of Americans, counter-intuitively, did not stem from the concept of an Imperial America, but rather, the declaration from Carroll and Coughlin that none other than Jesus of Nazareth, more colloquially and legendarily known as Jesus Christ, the eponymous prophet and central religious icon of Christianity, shall be coronated as King of the American Union State, the fulcrum point of all political and religious power in the continental United States. As it stands, this new political policy, as the press has generously described it, is perhaps the single most controversial political decision in the history of the modern world. In a similarly confounding statement to coincide with the proclamation, Philip Carroll announced that he would, in fact, be resigning as the President of the United States, and instead assume the role of the seemingly more modest title of Regent, acting in accordance with teachings of the Church, to oversee the administration of the new American Union State. Reactions to this declaration have been, to it mildly, perhaps as varied and mixed as they have ever been in the former United States; many Americans, even those among the Christian faithful, are flabbergasted at the notion of the apparatus of state being granted to an ethereal being in the judaic Son of God. Meanwhile, the markedly more outspokenly cynical critics of the Holy American League have openly denounced the move as a nakedly obvious and even delusional attempt to galvanize the religious population in America under the clerical dictatorship of Philip Carroll. How, in God's name, Carroll intends to legitimize this seemingly insane decision remains to be seen."

unionstate.311.d:0 "As part of [TEX.GetLeader]'s initiative to facilitate America's transition into a Catholic state, the Holy America League has begun a series of restoration efforts among some of America's historical sites related to the legacy of christian piety in the American spirit. One such site of major import to [TEX.GetLeader]'s initiative is the site of Saint Mary's City, the original American colony of Catholic settlers along the Chesapeake Bay, it is the first settlement of what would form the county, and eventually the state, of Maryland, and is credited as being the origin point of American values of religious freedom, being the first settlement to establish the mandate of religious practice for both Catholics and Protestants. In the centuries since the unification of the colonies, and the American revolution that followed, Saint Mary's City now functions as little more than a tourist attraction, the descendants of the original settlers long since moved on to the more populous regions such as Washington DC or Baltimore. Now, with the beginning of [TEX.GetLeader]'s initiative to reinvigorate the old colony, new construction projects for the development of the city, as part of an economic plan based on an obscure, Syndicalist-designed development scheme originally intended for the state of Nevada, will be initiated in the former Maryland hamlet, to utterly transform it into a shining gem in the heart the forests along the Mid-Atlantic, even though the initial estimates place the project's completion as late as 1954. It is becoming clear to many, based on the sheer scale of the endeavor, that [TEX.GetLeader] is determined to make America into an equally pious and prosperous nation, something to be admired in something more than mantra, and if the plans for Saint Mary's City are any indication, America is likely going to look very different in the near future."

With the continued threat of the Klan harrying the American people from the swamplands to the south, many African American converts have taken to forming citizen guards to protect rural WASP communities from opportunistic xenophobes and racial terrorists. The irony of the situation was not lost on the white southerners, as one might imagine; much of the suffering of black americans can be traced directly to the toxic influence of white supremacy in the Jim Crow South, infesting virtually every public service below the Black Belt, often at the direct beck and call of the Dixiecrats. The rise in popularity of these AD-HOC militias, known to these rural communities as "Knight Watchers", might mark the beginning of real change in America; Catholic and Protestant Whites have been more supportive of their dark skinned counterparts than ever before, and many communities in the south have taken to protesting racist institutions in the south, peacefully picketing police stations and Sheriff's offices in the name of godly solidarity with their fellow Americans. While the protestors are small in number, their message is loud and clear; that black lives matter and that all men are created equal."

Indeed, it is a massive undertaking on the part of the League, but more importantly, it clearly the very beginning of the effort to legitimize his administration in the eyes of the general populace, the beginning of a series of conversion efforts, the east coast and then working their way westward, until the entirety of the continental United States, from sea to shining sea, stands united under the gospel of the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit"

unionstate.314.d:0 "As the Holy American League continues its project of breathing life into the American economy, a raucous debate has surfaced within the League as to the specific plan for revamping the American financial sector. The origin of the schism within the League stems from ex-socialist activist Dorothy Day, and venerable New York governor Al Smith, both whom, despite ether's ideology necessarily aligning with the comparatively extreme Integralists within the League, still continue to work with the for the betterment of America. Day, whose mere presence within the League has been a point of contention since it's foundation, argues for transitioning the American economy to the model of Distributism; a communal form of economic decentralization based on Judeo-Christian values of sharing and charity, where the country's production would be widely owned by the American populace instead of by private enterprise. Naturally, such a measure of collectivization has scared the pants off many of the more moderate members of the League, Al Smith chief among them, who champions that American Capitalism and a free market are of vital importance the American economy, even invoking Charles of Carrollton's role in the Revolutionary War as a principle argument in favor of the preservation of private enterprise for the sake of American prosperity. Not wanting to be mistook for showing favoritism to one side, Philip Carroll has delegated the decision of what economic model to adopt to the dictation of Father Charles Coughlin, whose enmity for the leftist Day and liberalist Smith is well known, and would likely favor whatever economic plan he felt would be most practical for America's future."

unionstate.315.d:0 "Over the past several months, with the increasing prevalence of Catholic dogma asserting itself over the American psyche, a strange phenomenon has begun to percolate. What originally began with the Knight Watchers, those brave black men, devout in their adherence to God and fervent in the ideals of equality and solidarity with their countrymen, has rapidly blossomed into a multi-pronged phenomenon across the country as these small groupings of citizen militias, who have since grown in popularity across the continental United States, have begun adopting the pledges, titles, iconography and customs of full-fledged Knightly Orders in the fashion of the old European crusaders. In Maryland, the birthplace of the American Catholic, urban youths from Washington, Baltimore and the resurgent Saint Mary's City have organized themselves around the personal teachings and mantra of Philip Carroll and his family line as part of the eponymous Knights of Doughoregan Manor; in New York City, the austere and indomitable African Americans from the five boroughs have chosen to honor the bravery of the Harlem Hellfighters with the official formation of the Brooklyn Brotherhood; in New England, throngs of haughty, red-haired Irish Americans have flocked to the patriotically self-styled Antitemplars in defiance of the decedent king in Canada; in the Steel Belt, once the heartland of the Syndicalist Menace, has seen a plethora of men and women from Chicago, Detroit and Cincinnati, many of them medical workers, doctor and nurses, to join up with the new Red Hospitallers to guard against pro-Canadian propagandists across the Great Lakes; a similar phenomenon has sprouted up in the American southwest, along the border states with Mexico, militias have taken cues from their southern neighbors, with many women and Mexican Americans founding the Old Sonora Charter in honor of the Cristeros; along the Pacific Northwest, what started with a number of white volunteers in Oregon and Washington soon began to incorporate a growing number of Native-America converts, now lead by the Siletz nationalist, Hochmeister Elwood Towner, to defend the nation from internal and external threats, as the leader of the stalwart Order of the  Heartland. All of these groups of patriotic, pious soldiers, these modern day warriors of Jerusalem, have humbled Philip Carroll for their embracing of God's teachings, so much so that he has immediately enacted a decree to officially absorb these orders as an official part of the American military, where they serve abroad as a sterling example to all of the cultural unity and martial tenacity that God has brought them."

These are just the start of the League's educational reforms, and while it will, obviously, take time for the new teachings to take root, Philip Carroll and the League are confidently resolute that the next generation of American Catholic youth shall be the ones to see America flourish, both on the world stage and beyond."

Charles of Carrollton signed his name to the declaration that held the self-evident truth that all men were endowed by their creator, the impetus that loosed the arrow of American freedom at the heart of European hegemony, and it is here, in the righteous reincarnation of that very nation and by the proclamation of Charles of Carrollton's proud descendant and disciple, our Arch Regent Philip Acosta Carroll, that the separation of Church and State is hereby abolished. All institutions of the continental United States, from the office of the Arch Regent on down to the roles of the Civil Services, shall incorporate Christian oaths of service and loyalty upon hiring; all hospitals, fire stations and police departments shall incorporate Catholic Priests into the workplace to moralize and sanctify the civil services with the blessing of Christ; the Roman Catholic Chaplain Corps, a long standing branch of the American military, shall be granted special status within the armed forces to function as part of the newly created office of "Christian commissars" to further bolster the moral of our frontline forces.

All across America, states dedicated to the old American idols of democracy and justice are being torn down; Lady Justice, the embodiment judicial corruption, has herself been judged guilty; the Statue of Freedom, the sole surviving relic of the now destroyed Capital Building, now smelted to molten metal just as Huey Long and his cabal were; and worst and most unforgivable of all; the Confederates, these grotesque monuments to a failed rebellion dedicated to the terrible cult of slavery; Lee, Stonewall, Forrest, all icons of the subjugation and torture of American citizens in the name of states rights, these cannot, will not stand, and the cheers of righteous as they tear this monuments to sophistry and cruelty down off their foundations are enough to make any American beam with the most holy of catharsis. But last of all, the  repugnantly pale-green monument to American deceit disgracing the skyline of New York City, a gift to the American continent from the French, or rather, a statute to saiti the egos of the Americrat Oligarchs from their Jacobin cohorts, a revulsion against the new American spirit.

And God granted the land to the Exiles, and the Exiles took the land, from the land and shaped it, and formed it, and it's form was that of their creator, in God's image, and God was elated. And God blessed the newly formed land, and he blessed it with the fruits of God's Empire; he blessed them with prosperity, with great monoliths and populous metropole; he blessed them with mighty warriors, with brotherhoods among brotherhoods of holy crusaders, who hearts were as righteous as their swords; and he blessed them with a leader, and the leader was an apostle, a disciple, a teacher and a shepherd. And God blessed the shepherd, and granted him wisdom and zeal, and in the granting, the shepherd became the Arch Regent, and the Arch Regent was exultant; resplendent, was he, in the dress and garb befitting a Lord, for he was no lord, for he is of the Lord, for he is of the Prophet, The Arch Regent of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit.

We ourselves have acknowledged this duality, for it was bred into the very fabric of our nation from the moment Charles of Carrollton signed his name to the document that unleashed the United States upon the world. But that was when America was weak, and America is strong now. The Protestants have finally seen the light of this, and by God, they have closed their hearts to the poison of European heresy and opened it to Christ Almighty, here in this new, American Israel, a sanctuary to eclipse all sanctuaries. And still, there are those who rebuke our lord. and it is a rebuke that shall not be ignored any longer. There are the Evangelists; sick, demented, old criminals who corrupt their fellow Christians in archaic, obscene doctrines of racial superiority and moral decadence; Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Quakers, Puritans, all a blight, a taint, a corrosion of the perfect, incandescent American Spirit, and we demand compensation for this insult. By order of the Arch Regent, Lord Philip Acosta Carroll, like Cortes before him, shall conduct the first American Inquisition; from Anchorage to Miami, the country shall be made to kneel, the country shall be made to confess, and the country shall be made whole, pure in mind, body and spirit, free of all weakness, the best and greatest off all nations, and the equal of none of them.

unionstate.322.d:0 "The murmurs of a conspiracy in the White House for the transition from a democratic republic to a return to the rule of Empire have proven evidently true, with the Holy American League announcing via radio broadcast that the American Union State would hitherto reform into a constitutional monarchy, preserving American congressional and senatorial autonomy in concert with Philip Carroll's efforts to rebuild the country in accordance with his doctrine of American Integralism. Naturally, despite the preservation of the American democratic system, the news did not go over well with majority of the nation, this due in no small part to the nation's history of ardent opposition to Imperialism, with protests to the news erupting across the nation, many nearly escalating to full scale riots. Despite the intense opposition to this move, the potential for Carroll to legitimize this move might lie with the chosen candidate for the League's new America. Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba,is the chosen pretender to the new American crown; once the Foreign Minister for the ailing King Alfonso, the amiable, affluent Spaniard is the senior most living descendant of King James II, ruler of England, Ireland and Scotland, who's devout faith in Catholicism lead to his unlawful exile and the rise of the House of Windsor, prestaging the infamous Jacobite uprisings across Ireland and Scotland, to see the King restored and the people of Great Britain liberated from Anglican menace, even today, there are some in Scotland who believe Jacobo to be the rightful heir to Kingdom of Scotland. While this history might seem superfluous, there is, indeed, a realpolitik reasoning for Carroll's support of Stuart; not only does supporting the Jacobite claims to the British Crown in North America cunningly sidestep the role the monarchy itself had in the violent suppression of our ancestors, allowing Carroll to place the blame for said atrocities on the Anglo-Saxton-German blooded House of Windsor, but also do so in away that would garner support from the large and influential European-descended population in North America, with many Irish, Scottish and even Hispanic-Americans finding cause with Carroll's Integralists in their alignment with the Celt-Iberian aristocrat, supporting the League's attempt at European inspired monarchism in a manner that is paradoxically Pro-American."

The Canadians were right to leer at us from beyond our northern borders in between bouts of stating the whims of the ever-irreverent Edward VIII, for it was God's will that the true royal house of Britain, the one his countrymen exiled, whose peoples his family ravaged, and whose legacy and arrogance and pomp failed the Empire in the Great War so utterly, and that let loose the scions of Snowden, Hornier, Kenney, Glais and Mosely on Britannia. The Lord forgives everything, he has forgive the sins of America in ridding it of the scourge of the syndicalist that usurped the Isles, it was providence that brought the American Colossus under the tutelage of the rightful rulers of Britain, and it shall be with the light of Our Lord that the Empire shall stand redeemed in the eyes of Europe.

POLITICS_JACOBO_F_J_STUART:0 "Born the 17th of October 1878, Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba, now James III of America, has achieved a position he never even dreamed he would have. Before he assumed the long vacant throne of America, Jacobo had lived a fairly exciting life. He had been the Foreign Minister of Spain until 1931, an art collector and even an Olympic Medalist, wining a silver medal in polo at the 1924 Olympic Games in Berlin. On 7 October 1920 he married Maria del Rosario de Silva, 9th Marchioness of San Vicente del Barco. The two of them have had one daughter, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, Jacobo's heir-apparent.\nWhen Jacobo first received the letter inviting him to assume the throne of America, he was shocked. While he was the senior Jacobite claimant, he had never pushed the claim and he never expected to the claim to come into play, let alone in a breakoff colony that had been burning with the fires of Republicanism and anti-Catholicism since it's foundation. Yet here he is, King over a nation none ever thought would have a king again.\nAlthough he has been crowned, Jacobo has little to no power, as he was 'encouraged' by the same man who gave him the crown to give power over to him. Although Jacobo is clearly just a powerless figurehead, he has taken to his new role excellently, appearing in public almost everyday, be it giving speeches, appearing along side Regent Carroll or simply going for a walk with his family. While he may be a glorified rubber stamp for the Holy American League, Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart clearly loves his people, and they love him in return."

He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."

He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. \n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."

Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government.

On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiraling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshal along with Terry De La Mesa Sr."
TEX_TERRY_DE_LA_MESA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 1 April 1888, in Fort Douglas, Utah, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Allen was born into a family with a long tradition of military service. His grandfater, Colonel Carlos Alvarez de la Mesa, was a Spanish immigrant who fought for the Union in the Civil War. His father, Colonel Samuel Allen, also served in the military. In 1907, Allen was appointed to West Point in New York. Eventually, this would end in failure primarily due to a stutter, and Allen was kicked out of the school. However, after a successful education at the Catholic University of America, he got a second chance at a military career, and become a second lieutenant of the U.S. Cavalry assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia. Over the years, he has slowly climbed the ranks, and a freak accident that saw him shot in the jaw caused his stutter to disappear. While moving up the chain of command, Allen continued his military education at various institutions, from the U.S. Army Cavalry School and U.S. Army Command School, both in Kansas, to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He would continue his career as an instructor and eventually met George C. Marshall Jr., who promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Though he skipped the rank of Colonel that his familial predecessors had had, he did not mind, his focus being on the battlefield first and foremost. In fact, many have compared him to General George S. Patton in his approach to warfare, as his aggressive style and colorful style make him very similar to the more famous man. However, the two differ outside of those factors, as Allen cares little for his appearance and more for tactics, emphasizing night assaults and unpredictable plans. His confident, efficient style of leadership has given him one of the most promising careers in the U.S. Army. Or it did, until 1936, when Major General Omar Bradley clashed with Allen and caused Allen to flee west to the familiar state of Texas, where he had met his wife and served some of his first years of military service. There, he joined Huey Long's cause, and Long, recognizing his talent and high rank, immediately promoted him to the rank of Field Marshal alongside Jacob Denvers."

He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government. When Huey Long finally proclaimed the American Union State, Ridgway decided it was best to leave for the AUS if that was necessary to save America from anarchy, where he was promoted to Brigadier General."

With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival at Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General."
